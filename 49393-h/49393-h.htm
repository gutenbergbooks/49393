      CHAPTER I.&mdash;CAUSES OF THE WAR.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Franklin's Prediction&mdash;British Feeling toward the United States&mdash;The
      Unsurrendered Posts&mdash;Indian Troubles&mdash;Impressment of Seamen&mdash;The
      Decrees and Orders in Council&mdash;Declaration of War.</i>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he offender, says
      an Italian proverb, never forgives; and it is a singular fact that the
      deepest resentments and the most implacable hatreds are not those arising
      from a sense of injuries received, but from injuries inflicted. The victim
      of a deliberate wrong seldom treasures up a purpose of revenge, or demands
      anything more than a restoration of his rights; but the oppressor always
      hates those who have escaped from his oppression.
    </p>
    <p>
      That wise old philosopher, Ben Franklin, who died within seven years after
      the acknowledgment of our country as a separate nation in 1783, foresaw,
      even then, what did not take place till more than twenty years after his
      death. He declared that the war which had just closed in the surrender of
      Cornwallis was only the war of Revolution, and that the war of
      Independence was yet to be fought. <span class="pagenum">002</span><a
      name="link002" id="link002"></a>When, in June, 1785, George III. received
      John Adams as United States Minister at his court, he said: "I was the
      last man in the kingdom, Sir, to consent to the independence of America;
      but, now it is granted, I shall be the last man in the world to sanction a
      violation of it." If the King was sincere in this declaration, he must
      have had&mdash;as Lincoln said of himself when President&mdash;very little
      influence with the Administration; for, almost from the first, there was
      systematic disregard of the rights of the new nation, with an evident
      purpose to humiliate her people and cripple their commerce.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was hard for the British Ministry and British commanders to realize
      that those whom they had so lately attempted to chastise as rebels, that
      they might again tax them as subjects, were now, after their triumph in a
      long war, and by the terms of a solemn treaty, entitled to the same
      privileges on the ocean, and the same courtesies in diplomacy, that were
      accorded to the oldest nation of Europe. They knew as little of the spirit
      of the American people and the mighty destinies within the coming century,
      as of the resources of the vast continent which lay behind that thin line
      of civilization along the Atlantic coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      This failure to realize, or reluctance to admit, that the people of
      America were no longer British sub<span class="pagenum">003</span><a
      name="link003" id="link003"></a>jects, and that the United States was an
      independent nation, was forcibly illustrated in England's disregard, for
      thirty years, of an important portion of the Treaty of 1783. It was there
      stipulated that the military posts on our western frontier should be
      surrendered to our Government. Yet not only did the British forces retain
      possession of them, but from them they supplied the Indians with arms and
      ammunition, and instigated savage hostilities against the American
      settlements. Attempts have been made to deny this, but the proof is
      unquestionable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Dorchester, Governor of Canada, called a council of the Indian
      tribes, engaged to supply them with munitions of war, encouraged them to
      enmity against the United States, and gave them to understand that they
      would have the co-operation of his Government. These facts were published
      in British newspapers, and when the British Minister was asked to account
      for them, he could give no satisfactory answer. In pursuance of this
      policy, when war broke out, in 1812, the English commanders not only
      employed Indian allies, but offered and paid a regular bounty for American
      scalps. It seems incredible that such things could have been done, only
      seventy years ago, by one of the most enlightened governments on earth.
      And yet in our own day we have seen the performance repeated, <span
      class="pagenum">004</span><a name="link004" id="link004"></a>when the
      English in South Africa armed the native savages with the best English
      rifles, that they might make war upon the peaceful and industrious Boers
      of the Transvaal Republic.
    </p>
    <p>
      But our people had a grievance, of more than twenty years' standing, which
      was even more serious than this. While the frontiersman was contending
      with British treachery and Indian ferocity, which combined to hinder the
      development of our inland resources, the American sailor&mdash;then the
      best in the world, as was proved by the result of the war&mdash;was
      confronted by a monstrous policy intended to check our growing commerce
      and recruit the English navy at our expense.
    </p>
    <p>
      England was at this time the greatest commercial nation in the world. Her
      merchant ships and whalers were found on every sea, gathering and
      distributing the productions of every land. In herself she was but an
      island, not larger than one of our States&mdash;a very beautiful and
      fertile island, it is true; but if her jurisdiction had not extended
      beyond its borders, she would have been hardly more important than
      Switzerland or Sweden. But in her colonies and her commerce she was
      powerful. And now the finest of those colonies, casting off her authority
      in the only successful rebellion ever waged against it, were rapidly
      building up a mercantile marine <span class="pagenum">005</span><a
      name="link005" id="link005"></a>that threatened to rival her own. They had
      thousands of miles of seacoast, with innumerable fine harbors; they had
      behind them, not a crowded island, but a virgin continent; the
      construction of their government and society was such that the poorest man
      before the mast might not unreasonably hope some day to command a ship.
      With all this, they were not involved in the wars which were then
      distracting Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being neutrals, of course they enjoyed those advantages which England has
      never been slow to reap when she herself has been a neutral while her
      neighbors were at war. Their ships could carry goods which in any other
      ships would have been seized by hostile cruisers. England was now&mdash;as
      she truly said, in extenuation of her depredation on American commerce&mdash;struggling
      for her very existence, against mighty armies led by the ablest general
      that had appeared since Alexander. Many of the most desirable ports were
      closed to her merchantmen, her entire coast was declared by Napoleon to be
      under blockade; and it was exasperating in the last degree to see these
      misfortunes redounding to the advantage of a people whom she had so lately
      treated as rebels and outlaws, whose military prowess she had affected to
      despise, until it had disarmed her legions and conquered an honorable
      peace. <span class="pagenum">006</span><a name="link006" id="link006"></a>The
      motive that controlled British policy was plainly revealed in an editorial
      article which appeared in the London <i>Independent Whig</i> (January
      10th, 1813), after the war had been begun and the British public had been
      astounded by the capture of two or three of their finest frigates.
      "Accustomed, as we have hitherto been, to a long and uninterrupted tide of
      success upon the watery element, and claiming an absolute and exclusive
      sovereignty over the ocean, to be defeated there, where we securely rested
      our proudest hopes and wishes, might reasonably be expected to check our
      insolence and mortify our pride. In this view of the case, and if we could
      not flatter ourselves that it would have the effect of inducing us to
      abate somewhat of our unwarrantable pretensions, and listen to terms of
      moderation and forbearance, our regret would be sensibly diminished; since
      even the misfortune, severe as it is, might be converted into a great and
      lasting benefit to the nation at large. But the mischief will not confine
      itself here; the charm of the invincibility of the British navy, like that
      of the Grecian warrior, being destroyed, the terror that has long preceded
      our flag, and commanded the abject homage of surrounding nations, will
      henceforward be dissipated, and every maritime power with whom we may be
      involved in war will fight with redoubled zeal, ar<span class="pagenum">007</span><a
      name="link007" id="link007"></a>dently and anxiously hoping to lower our
      ascendency and establish the freedom of the seas." That was it exactly;
      they were afraid somebody would establish the freedom of the seas, and at
      that time the Americans seemed most likely to do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the Napoleonic wars, in the early years of the present century,
      England's navy consisted of about one thousand vessels. As she was
      recruiting this vast squadron by perpetual press-gangs, and maintaining
      its discipline by unstinted flogging, while at the same time the
      flourishing merchant marine of the United States was paying more liberal
      wages to men before the mast than could be obtained on the English
      merchantmen, it might have been expected that the number of desertions
      would only be limited by the number of opportunities to desert. Many of
      the deserters undoubtedly found employment on American ships, where
      British captains soon established the custom of searching for and
      reclaiming them. This was a gross violation of the sovereignty of the
      United States, for the deck of an American vessel is to all intents and
      purposes American territory; yet our Government permitted it, and only
      complained of what were considered its incidental abuses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The troubles that followed from this beginning remind us of the fable of
      the camel and the tailor. <span class="pagenum">008</span><a name="link008"
      id="link008"></a>England's next step was to claim that no British subject
      had a right to enter any military or marine service but the British, and
      that any who did so might be taken by British authorities wherever found&mdash;just
      as if they were deserters.
    </p>
    <p>
      But presently it appeared that something more was needed in order to give
      Great Britain the full benefit of these assumptions. An English war-vessel
      stops an American merchantman on the high sea, and sends an officer with
      armed men on board to inspect the crew and take off any that are British
      subjects. The officer selects some of the ablest seamen he finds, and
      claims them. Immediately a dispute arises; the seamen say they are
      American citizens&mdash;or at least not British subjects; the officer says
      they were born subjects of the English king, and can never throw off their
      allegiance. Here is a question of fact, and by all the principles of law
      and justice it would devolve upon the officer to prove his claim. But as
      the purpose was, not to do justice, but to recruit the British navy, the
      admission of any such principle would hardly answer the purpose. So the
      British Government set up the doctrine that the burden of proof rested
      with the accused; that is, any sailor who was unable to prove on the spot,
      to the satisfaction of the boarding officer, that he was <i>not</i> a
      British subject, was to be <span class="pagenum">009</span><a
      name="link009" id="link009"></a>considered as such, and carried off to
      serve against his will on a British ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      The English naval commanders were now fully equipped for this new method
      of recruiting, and it soon became the practice for them to board American
      merchantmen and take off as many of the best sailors as they happened to
      be in need of at the time, with very little reference to their
      nationality. Some of the men thus forcibly carried off were released by
      order of the Admiralty, on the application of the American Consul, with
      the apology that, as English and Americans spoke the same language and
      were of the same race, it was often difficult to distinguish between them.
      But as a matter of fact the sailors thus impressed included men of nearly
      every European nationality&mdash;Germans, Swedes, Danes, Portuguese, and
      even negroes. In 1811 it was believed that more than six thousand American
      sailors were serving under compulsion in the British navy; and Mr. Lyman,
      United States Consul at London, estimated the number at fourteen thousand.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was only the natural result of the original error committed by our
      Government when it admit ted the right to search for and carry away
      deserters. And the impressments took place not only on the high seas but
      often within the three miles from shore to which a maritime country's
      jurisdiction extends, <span class="pagenum">010</span><a name="link010"
      id="link010"></a>and sometimes in the very harbors of the United States.
      Coasting and fishing schooners were robbed of their men, and occasionally
      fired upon and plundered; while of larger vessels bound for distant
      waters, the crews were sometimes so depleted by visit from a British
      man-of-war that the voyage was broken up and the ship compelled to return
      to port.
    </p>
    <p>
      The greatest of these outrages was the capture of the <i>Chesapeake</i>, a
      United States frigate, by the British man-of-war <i>Leopard</i>, June 23d,
      1806. The <i>Chesapeake</i>, which had just left Hampton Roads for a
      cruise, had not been put in fighting trim; not a single gun was ready for
      use. Her commander, Commodore James Barron, refused to permit a search for
      British deserters, and the <i>Leopard</i> thereupon fired several
      broadsides into her, when she struck her flag. Three of her crew were
      killed, and eighteen wounded. The <i>Leopard</i> carried away four of her
      men, claiming them as deserters; but it was afterward proved that three of
      them were Americans, and they were released, while the fourth was tried
      and executed at Halifax.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the <i>Chesapeake</i> returned to Norfolk, Va., with the news, it
      created the greatest excitement the country had seen since the
      Revolutionary war. Indignation meetings were held, and the people seemed
      almost unanimous in a desire to plunge at <span class="pagenum">011</span><a
      name="link011" id="link011"></a>once into war. A schooner was sent to
      England by our Government, carrying instructions to the American Minister
      to demand apology and reparation. These were made, after a fashion; but
      the English Government refused to give up the right of search. President
      Jefferson, who thought anything, under any circumstances, was better than
      war, issued a proclamation ordering all British vessels of war then in
      United States waters to leave at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, England had attempted to revive what was known as "the rule of
      1756." During the war of that year she had tried to establish a rule that
      neutral nations were not at liberty to trade with the colonies of a
      belligerent power from which, in times of peace, they were excluded by the
      parent state. For instance, if in time of peace France permitted none but
      her own vessels to trade at the ports of certain of her colonies, she
      should not be allowed, when at war, to have that trade carried on for her
      in vessels belonging to a neutral nation; and if such vessels attempted
      it, they should be liable to capture and confiscation by cruisers of the
      nation which was at war with France. Such a regulation of course belongs
      to the domain of international law, and cannot be established by one
      nation alone. This rule had been frequently disregarded by England
      herself, and had never received the sanction of <span class="pagenum">012</span><a
      name="link012" id="link012"></a>other powers; but by orders in council, of
      November 6th, 1793, she secretly instructed her naval commanders to
      enforce it against American vessels trading to the French colonies of the
      West Indies. The United States Government sent commissioners to London,
      English commissioners were appointed to meet them, and a treaty of "amity,
      commerce, and navigation" was concluded, which was ratified by both
      governments in 1795. Yet the capture and condemnation of American vessels
      went on almost as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the early European wars of this century, the days of paper blockade&mdash;a
      blockade which consists merely in a proclamation, without the presence of
      armed vessels to enforce it&mdash;were not yet over, and on May 16th,
      1806, England declared the whole coast of the Continent, from Brest to the
      mouth of the Elbe, to be in a state of blockade. Napoleon retaliated by
      issuing from Berlin a counter decree, dated November 21st, 1806, which
      declared the entire coast of Great Britain to be under blockade, and
      prohibited any vessel which sailed from a British port from entering a
      Continental port. England then, by orders in council, published November
      17th, 1807, prohibited all neutral trade with France and her allies,
      except in vessels that had first entered a British port. As paper and ink
      were cheap, and <span class="pagenum">013</span><a name="link013"
      id="link013"></a>by this time so little was left of the rights of neutrals
      that it was hardly worth while to regard them at all, Napoleon tried his
      hand at one more decree. Under date of Milan, December 17th, 1807, he
      proclaimed that any vessel which should submit to search by British
      cruisers, or pay any tax to the British Government, should be forfeit as
      good prize.
    </p>
    <p>
      These so-called measures of retaliation&mdash;which became famous as the
      "orders in council," and the "Berlin and Milan decrees"&mdash;had very
      little effect upon the people who were at war, but they laid some of the
      heaviest penalties of war upon the one maritime nation that was at peace
      with all. Instead of resorting to war at once, the United States
      Government, being as well able as any other to issue a foolish
      proclamation, laid an embargo, December 22d, 1807, upon all shipping in
      American ports, prohibiting exportations therefrom. This measure met with
      violent opposition in New England, which was more largely interested in
      commerce than any other part of the country. The coast of New England
      presented innumerable harbors, and her forests were full of the finest
      ship-timber, while in agriculture she could not compete with the States
      having richer soils and a less rigorous climate. Cotton-spinning was in
      its infancy, and the manufactures that were to employ her water-powers had
      not been <span class="pagenum">014</span><a name="link014" id="link014"></a>developed.
      She naturally and properly looked to the carrying trade as her best means
      of livelihood. The orders in council and the Berlin and Milan decrees
      imposed great risks and unjust restrictions upon it, but did not
      altogether destroy it; the embargo suppressed it at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      In March, 1809, Congress repealed the embargo, and substituted a system of
      non-importation and non-intercourse with France and Great Britain. Voyages
      to their dominions, and trade in articles produced by them, were
      prohibited; but it was provided that whenever either of those nations
      should repeal its decrees against neutral commerce, the restriction should
      be removed as to that nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      This at last produced some effect, and the French Government revoked the
      Berlin and Milan decrees, the revocation to take effect on the 1st of
      November, 1810; the letter of the French Minister communicating the fact
      to the American Minister adding that it was "clearly understood that the
      English orders in council were to be revoked at the same time." In August
      of that year, Hon. William Pinkney, United States Minister at London, laid
      this before the British Government, but was told that the English decrees
      would be revoked "after the French revocation should have actually taken
      place." This was a most palpable evasion, since it <span class="pagenum">015</span><a
      name="link015" id="link015"></a>is very common for treaties and
      governmental orders to contain clauses which render them operative only in
      certain contingencies, and it was the easiest thing in the world for
      England to give her revocation precisely the same form as that of France,
      when each would have put the other in force on the date named. If any
      further proof had been wanted that the British Government was determined
      to suppress American commerce, at least till her own ships could resume
      the carrying trade of the world, it was supplied when in 1812 Lord
      Castlereagh, Minister for Foreign Affairs, declared officially that "the
      decrees of Berlin and Milan must not be repealed singly and specially, in
      relation to the United States, but must be repealed also as to all other
      neutral nations; and that in no less extent of a repeal of the French
      decrees had the British Government pledged itself to repeal the orders in
      council." That is, the rights of the United States as a neutral nation
      were not to be regarded by England, unless the United States could induce
      or compel France to regard not only these rights but those of all other
      neutral nations!
    </p>
    <p>
      With this tangle of orders, decrees, and proclamations, with an important
      part of the Treaty of 1783 unfulfilled, with unlawful impressments daily
      taking place on the high seas, and with no disposition on the part of the
      chief aggressor to right these wrongs, <span class="pagenum">016</span><a
      name="link016" id="link016"></a>it is difficult to see how negotiations
      could have been continued longer, or the alternative of war avoided. On
      the first day of June, 1812, President Madison sent a message to Congress,
      in which he set forth the facts that necessitated war; Congress
      accordingly declared war on the 18th, and the next day the President
      proclaimed it. On the 23d, before this news was received, England revoked
      her orders in council, thus removing one of the grievances, but still
      leaving those which amply justified the declaration.
    </p>
    <p>
      It thus appears that the immediate and specific causes of the war of 1812
      between the United States and Great Britain were complex; but the general
      cause, the philosophic reason, was simply the determined purpose
      manifested by England to nullify and render valueless the political
      independence gained by the American colonies in the Revolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the inauguration of President Jefferson, in 1801, the Government had
      been in the hands of the Republicans, and all measures looking toward war
      with England were opposed by the party out of power&mdash;the Federalists.
      The young reader must not be confused by the change of names which
      political parties have undergone between that day and this. The Republican
      party of Jefferson's day was <span class="pagenum">017</span><a
      name="link017" id="link017"></a>the predecessor of what is now called the
      Democratic party; while the Republican party of our own day is to some
      extent the successor of the Federal party of that day. Presidents
      Washington and Adams were Federalists, or what would now be called
      Republicans; Presidents Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe were Republicans,
      or what would now be called Democrats.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Federalists in Congress protested against the declaration of war; and
      this protest was repeated in every possible form by the Federal
      newspapers, by mass-meetings, in numerous political pamphlets, and even in
      many pulpits. The opposition was especially strong in the New England
      States. The arguments of those who opposed the war were, that the country
      was not prepared for such a struggle, could not afford it, and would find
      it a hopeless undertaking; that the war policy had been forced upon
      Madison's administration by the Republican party, in order to strengthen
      that party and keep it in power; that if we had cause for war with
      England, we had cause for war with France also, and it was unreasonable to
      declare war against one of those powers and not against both. The last
      argument was the one most vehemently urged, and the war party was denounced
      and sneered at as making our Government a tool of France. <span
      class="pagenum">018</span><a name="link018" id="link018"></a>There was a
      certain amount of truth in each of these propositions. The country was
      poorly prepared for war at all, least of all with the most powerful of
      nations. Madison probably had been given to understand that unless he
      recommended a declaration of war, he need not expect a renomination at the
      hands of his party. And we certainly had cause of war with France, whose
      cruisers had captured or destroyed many of our merchantmen. But the
      position of the Federalists on this question furnishes a singular example
      of the fact that an argument may sometimes be true in each of its parts,
      and yet incorrect in its grand conclusion. It seldom happens that any
      people are prepared for a just and defensive war; they begin their
      preparations for such a contest after the necessity is upon them. While a
      portion of the Republican party were undoubtedly actuated by selfish
      motives, as is the case with some portion of every party, the greater part
      were unquestionably patriotic, and advocated war because they believed it
      to be necessary. The crowning argument&mdash;that the United States had a
      grievance against France as well as England, and should make war on both
      if on either&mdash;would have been unanswerable if it had been a moral
      warfare that was in question. But in military matters it is necessary to
      consider what is practicable as well as what is logi<span class="pagenum">019</span><a
      name="link019" id="link019"></a>cal. For our Government to attempt to
      fight England and France at the same time, would have been simply
      suicidal. A good general strives to divide his foes, instead of uniting
      them. The shrewd thing to do was, to declare war against one only, and by
      saying nothing of any grievance against the other, make of that other
      either an ally or a neutral. Then if the war was successful on our part,
      it would put an end to the outrages complained of, not only on the part of
      the nation with whom we had fought, but also on that of the other; or if
      not, a war with the second offender would almost necessarily have the same
      result. The only question was, with which of those great European powers
      we should attempt to cope in battle. It was not difficult to decide.
      England was by far the greater offender. Not only had she done more than
      France to cripple our commerce, but she still held military posts on our
      frontier which she had solemnly agreed to give up, and kept the savages in
      a state of perpetual hostility to our western pioneers. England had
      colonies contiguous to our territory on the north, which we might make the
      battle-ground; France had no territory that would serve us for such a
      purpose. England was the power that our people had been compelled to fight
      thirty years before, to escape from oppression; France was the power that
      <span class="pagenum">020</span><a name="link020" id="link020"></a>had
      assisted us in that war. Mr. Madison's Administration was right in the
      conclusion that war could no longer be avoided, if the United States was
      to maintain an honorable place among nations; and right in the
      determination to wage it against England alone. But for the manner in
      which it began and conducted that war, the Administration was open to the
      severest criticism.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was perhaps
      characteristic of the conduct of the war, that the first blood spilled
      should be American blood, shed by Americans. This occurred in a riot,
      occasioned by high party feeling, and it is a curious fact that it took
      place in the same city where the first blood was shed, also by riot, in
      the great war of the Rebellion, half a century later. In the night of June
      22d, three days after the proclamation of war, a mob in Baltimore sacked
      the office of the <i>Federal Republican</i>, edited by Alexander Hanson,
      because he had opposed the war policy. The mob also attacked the
      residences of several prominent Federalists, and burned one of them.
      Vessels in the harbor, too, were visited and plundered. About a month
      later Hanson resumed the publication of his paper, and in the night of
      July 26th the mob gathered again. This had been expected, and Hanson was
      ready for them. A large <span class="pagenum">022</span><a name="link022"
      id="link022"></a>number of his friends, including Generals James M. Lingan
      and Henry Lee, offered to assist him in protecting his property. When the
      rioters burst into the building, they were at once fired upon, and one of
      them was killed and several were wounded. The authorities were slow and
      timid in dealing with the riot; and when at length a force of militia was
      called out, instead of firing upon the mob, or capturing the ringleaders,
      they arrested Hanson and his friends, and lodged them in jail. The
      rioters, thus encouraged by those whose business it was to punish them,
      attacked the jail the next night, murdered General Lingan, injured General
      Lee so that he was a cripple for the rest of his life, and beat several of
      the other victims and subjected them to torture. The leaders of the mob
      were brought to trial, but were acquitted!

    <p>
      In this state of affairs, the war party in the country being but little
      stronger than the peace party, the youngest and almost the weakest of
      civilized nations went to war with one of the oldest and most powerful.
      The regular army of the United States numbered only six thousand men; but
      Congress had passed an act authorizing its increase to twenty-five
      thousand, and in addition to this the President was empowered to call for
      fifty thousand volunteers, and to use the militia to the extent of one
      hundred <span class="pagenum">023</span><a name="link023" id="link023"></a>thousand.
      Henry Dearborn, of Massachusetts, was made a major-general and appointed
      to command the land forces. Against the thousand vessels and one hundred
      and forty-four thousand sailors of the British navy, the Americans had
      twenty war-ships and a few gunboats, the whole carrying about three
      hundred guns.
    </p>
    <p>
      But these figures, taken alone, are deceptive; since a very large part of
      the British force was engaged in the European wars, and the practical
      question was, what force the United States could bring against so much as
      England could spare for operations on the high seas and on this side of
      the Atlantic. In that comparison, the discrepancy was not so great, and
      the United States had an enormous element of strength in her fine merchant
      marine. Her commerce being temporarily suspended to a large degree, there
      was an abundance both of ships and sailors, from which to build up a navy
      and fit out a fleet of privateers. Indeed, privateering was the business
      that now offered the largest prizes to mariners and ship-owners. Yet so
      blind was President Madison's Administration to the country's main
      strength and advantage, that he actually proposed to lay up all the naval
      vessels, as the only means of saving them from capture. Of what use it
      would be to save from capture war-vessels which were not to <span
      class="pagenum">024</span><a name="link024" id="link024"></a>sail the sea
      in time of war, he seems not to have thought. From this fatal error he was
      saved by the pluck and foresight of Captains Stewart and Bain-bridge.
      Those two officers happened fortunately to be in Washington at the time,
      and succeeded in persuading the Administration to give up this plan and
      order the vessels fitted for sea at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      War with Great Britain being determined upon, the plan of campaign that
      first and most strongly presented itself to the Administration was the
      conquest of the British provinces on our northern border. This had been
      attempted during the Revolution without success, but none the less
      confidence was felt in it now. And it was certainly correct in principle,
      though it proved wofully disastrous in the execution. It is observable
      that in all recent wars, the party on whose ground the fighting has taken
      place has been in the end the losing party. Thus the Mexican war in 1846-7
      was fought in Mexican territory, and the Mexicans were defeated. The
      Crimean war was fought in Russian territory, and the Russians were
      defeated. The war between France and Austria, in 1859, was fought in
      Austrian territory, and the Austrians were defeated. The
      Schleswig-Holstein war was fought in Danish territory, and the Danes were
      defeated. The war between Prussia and Austria, in 1866, was fought in
      <span class="pagenum">025</span><a name="link025" id="link025"></a>Austrian
      territory, and the Austrians were defeated. The Franco-German war of 1870
      was fought in French territory, and France was defeated. The Russo-Turkish
      war of 1877 was fought in Turkish territory, and the Turks were defeated.
      The war of the American Rebellion was fought in territory claimed by the
      rebels, and they were defeated. It only needs that a war should continue
      long enough for us to see where the battle-ground is to be, and we can
      then tell what will be its result. The reason is obvious. A nation that is
      strong enough to carry the war into its enemy's country, and keep it
      there, will certainly prove strong enough to win in the end, unless
      interference by some other power prevents it; while a nation that is too
      weak to keep war, with all its devastation and ruin, out of its territory,
      must certainly be defeated unless assisted by some neighboring people. The
      invaders may, and probably will, lose the greater number of men in the
      pitched battles; but it is not their harvests that will be trampled, not
      their mills that will be burned, not their bridges that will be blown up,
      not their homes that will be desolated, not their families that must fly
      for shelter to the caves and the forests. Their sources of supply are
      untouched. This principle was recognized by Scipio, when he declared that
      the war with Carthage "must be carried into Africa." <span class="pagenum">026</span><a
      name="link026" id="link026"></a>As England claimed to be mistress of the
      seas, and practically the claim was almost true, the determination to send
      our little navy and a fleet of privateers against her was essentially
      carrying the war into English territory. And as this part of the contest
      was conducted with skill and valor, it was gloriously successful.
    </p>
    <p>
      An invasion of Canada being determined upon, the first question that
      necessarily arose was, at what point that country should first be
      attacked. To any one not skilled in military science the most obvious plan
      would seem the best&mdash;to march as large a force as possible, without
      delay, into Canada at the nearest point. A young officer, Major Jesup, of
      Kentucky, sent a memorial to the Secretary of War, in which he set forth a
      totally different plan from this. He proposed that a strong expedition
      should be fitted out to capture and hold Halifax, which was then a city of
      fifteen thousand inhabitants, with the most important harbor in the
      Canadian provinces. As a precedent, he could refer to the capture of
      Louis-burg in 1748. But the Secretary, Hon. William Eustis, of
      Massachusetts, spoke of it contemptuously as "a very pretty plan," and set
      it aside. Yet it was sound in principle, and if properly carried out could
      hardly have failed to secure important results. In striking an enemy on
      the flank, it is <span class="pagenum">027</span><a name="link027"
      id="link027"></a>always desirable, to choose that flank by which he holds
      communication with his base. A blow on the other flank may inflict injury,
      but it only drives him back toward his base. A movement that cuts him off
      from such communication compels him either to surrender or to fight at
      great disadvantage Canada's base&mdash;for many supplies, and largely for
      soldiers&mdash;was England. The port of Quebec was frozen up nearly half
      the year, and the occupation of Halifax by an American force would have
      gone far toward severing the connection between the provinces and the
      mother country. That harbor, too, was all-important for the refuge and
      refitting of British naval vessels on this side of the Atlantic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking at the matter as purely a military problem, it was a pity that
      this brilliant plan was not adopted. But in a larger consideration it is
      probably fortunate for us that it was not. It might have resulted&mdash;indeed,
      that was contemplated in the plan&mdash;in leaving the Americans, at the
      close of the war, in possession of Canada. As the structure of our
      government almost precludes the holding of conquered provinces as such for
      any length of time, the Canadas must have soon become States of the
      Republic. But, so far from that being desirable in 1815, it may be doubted
      whether even yet the time has arrived when it would be wise to incorporate
      <span class="pagenum">028</span><a name="link028" id="link028"></a>that
      undesirable population, in a body as they are, with the people of the
      United States.
    </p>
    <p>
      In planning for the invasion of Canada, the Administration counted largely
      upon a supposed readiness of the Canadians to throw off their allegiance
      to Great Britain and join with the United States. Such expectations have
      almost never been realized, and in this instance they were completely
      disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the preceding February, William Hull, Governor of the Territory of
      Michigan, who had rendered distinguished service in the Revolution, had
      been made a brigadier-general and placed in command of the forces in Ohio,
      with orders to march them to Detroit, to protect the Territory against the
      Indians, who were becoming troublesome. In June he was in command of about
      two thousand men, in northern Ohio, moving slowly through the wilderness.
      On the day when war was declared, June 18th, the Secretary of War wrote
      him two letters. The first, in which the declaration was not mentioned,
      was despatched by a special messenger, and reached General Hull on the
      24th. The other informed him of the declaration of war, but was sent by
      mail to Cleveland, there to take its chance of reaching the General by
      whatever conveyance might be found. The consequence was, that he did not
      <span class="pagenum">029</span><a name="link029" id="link029"></a>receive
      it till the 2d of July. But every British commander in Canada learned the
      news several days earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hull arrived at Detroit on the 5th of July, and set about organizing his
      forces. On the 9th he received from the War Department orders to begin the
      invasion of Canada by taking possession of Malden, fifteen miles below
      Detroit, on the other side of the river, if he thought he could do so with
      safety to his own posts.
    </p>
    <p>
      He crossed on the 12th, and issued a proclamation to the Canadians. In
      this he told them that he came to do no injury to peaceable citizens, who
      might remain at their homes and pursue their usual occupations in
      security; that he neither asked nor needed their help, but would accept
      the services of such as might volunteer; and that no quarter would be
      given to any who adopted Indian modes of warfare or were found fighting in
      company with the savages who were accustomed to scalp prisoners and murder
      non-combatants. After the campaign had resulted disastrously, General Hull
      was censured and ridiculed for this proclamation; but a copy had been
      transmitted to the Secretary of War, and approved by him; and indeed, if a
      proclamation was to be issued, it is difficult to find any serious fault
      with Hull's. The error was in issuing any at all&mdash;a <span
      class="pagenum">030</span><a name="link030" id="link030"></a>thing which a
      general seldom does with any good effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hull fortified his camp on the east side of the river, and while waiting
      for his artillery sent out reconnoitring parties toward Fort Malden, and
      detachments to bring in supplies. As his troops grew impatient, he called
      a council of war, explained the situation to his officers, and offered to
      lead them in an attempt to carry the fort by storm, without waiting for
      artillery, if they thought their men could be relied upon for such an
      enterprise. Colonel Miller answered that his regiment of regulars could be
      depended upon for anything they might be ordered to do; but the three
      militia colonels very wisely answered that raw militia could not be
      expected to storm a fortified place, unaided by artillery&mdash;one of the
      most hazardous of all military exploits.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it was decided to defer the attack, and in a few days came the news
      that on the declaration of war, a force of over six hundred&mdash;British
      and Indians&mdash;had promptly moved against the American post at
      Michilimackinac&mdash;on the rocky little island of Mackinaw, commanding
      the strait between Lake Huron and Lake Michigan&mdash;and the garrison of
      sixty-one officers and men capitulated on the 16th of July. This disaster
      to the Americans roused the Indians to renewed hostility against them,
      while it propor<span class="pagenum">031</span><a name="link031"
      id="link031"></a>tionately disheartened Hull, and seems to have been the
      first step in the breaking down of his courage. After a few skirmishes, he
      recrossed to Detroit on the 7th of August.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the British Colonel Proctor had arrived at Malden with
      reënforcements, and on Hull's withdrawal to Detroit he threw a force
      across the river to intercept his supplies. This force consisted of a
      small number of British regulars and a considerable number of Indians
      commanded by the famous Tecumseh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Learning that a supply train, accompanied by a few volunteers, was coming
      to him and had got as far as the River Raisin, about thirty-five miles
      south of Detroit, General Hull sent out a detachment of about two hundred
      men, under Major Thomas B. Van Horne, to meet it and escort it to camp.
      This detachment was attacked by the British and savages at Brownstown,
      twenty miles from Detroit. Van Horne was surprised, and retreated to the
      edge of a wood. His men behaved badly, and could not be got into line,
      another retreat was ordered, and finally they ran away in confusion,
      having lost eighteen killed, twelve wounded, and seventy missing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hull sent out another detachment, of six hundred men, under
      Lieutenant-Colonel James Miller, to open communication with the supply
      train, which <span class="pagenum">032</span><a name="link032" id="link032"></a>was
      more fortunate. At Maguaga, fourteen miles from Detroit, they came upon
      the enemy intrenched behind a breastwork of logs. The British were
      commanded by Major Muir, the savages by Tecumseh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miller at once ordered a bayonet charge, which his men executed in gallant
      style. The enemy were driven from their works, after some hard fighting,
      and pursued for two miles. They finally reached their boats, and crossed
      to Malden, but nearly a hundred Indians lay dead on the field, and the
      English had lost fifteen killed and forty wounded. The American loss was
      fifteen killed and sixty wounded. Instead of pushing on to the River
      Raisin, and securing the supplies. Colonel Miller returned with his
      command to Detroit.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the direct road on which all these operations had taken place lay along
      the river-bank, in sight of the enemy and exposed to the fire of his
      gunboats, Hull now sent out a detachment under Colonels McArthur and Cass,
      to escort the train by a circuitous route, farther from the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this gloomy state of things at Detroit, a bloody affair took place
      on ground that is now within the city of Chicago. Fort Dearborn stood at
      the mouth of Chicago River, and was occupied by a garrison of about fifty
      soldiers, with several families. Captain Nathan Heald, commanding the
      <span class="pagenum">033</span><a name="link033" id="link033"></a>post,
      had been ordered by General Hull to abandon it and remove his force to
      Detroit. With so small a force, moving more than two hundred miles through
      a wilderness in time of war, it was especially desirable to retain the
      good will of the Indians. Captain Heald accordingly called a council of
      those who professed to be friendly, told them of his intended movement,
      and promised to give them all the property in the fort that he could not
      take with him, at which they were greatly pleased. But in the night,
      knowing their intemperance and fearing their treachery, he destroyed all
      the alcohol, firearms, and gunpowder which he could not take away. These
      were the very articles that the Indians most highly valued, and when,
      after his departure next morning (August 15th), they discovered the trick
      that had been played them, they were very much enraged, and hurried on to
      overtake him. He was moving slowly southward along the shore of the lake,
      when the crest of a low range of sand-hills on his right was suddenly
      lighted up with a blaze of musketry. The savages were there in ambush,
      mercilessly firing upon the little caravan. As quickly as possible the
      wagons were drawn up together, and the women and children given shelter in
      and behind them, while the soldiers stood their ground, and returned the
      fire of the Indians. It was a brave <span class="pagenum">034</span><a
      name="link034" id="link034"></a>and bloody fight, and when some of the men
      had fallen the women took up their rifles and fired upon the savages with
      all the courage and coolness of soldiers. But after heavy losses, the
      survivors of the party were compelled to surrender. In the course of the
      fight, an Indian had made his way to the wagons, and, springing into one
      in which twelve children had been placed, tomahawked every one of them.
      The victorious savages scalped all the wounded, claiming that they had not
      been included in the capitulation, and the bloody trophies were sold to
      Colonel Proctor, who had offered a premium for American scalps.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fight near Fort Dearborn took place on the same day that the
      detachment under Colonels McArthur and Cass left Detroit. The next day,
      August 15th, the British General Isaac Brock, who had arrived at Malden a
      few days before and assumed command there, formally demanded the surrender
      of Detroit. This demand included a plain threat of massacre in case of
      refusal. Said Brock in his letter: "It is far from my intention to join in
      a war of extermination; but you must be aware that the numerous bodies of
      Indians who have attached themselves to my troops will be beyond my
      control the moment the contest commences." This is a fine example of the
      art of putting things; The reader <span class="pagenum">035</span><a
      name="link035" id="link035"></a>would suppose from Brock's words&mdash;"the
      Indians who have attached themselves to my troops"&mdash;that the savages
      in red skins had insisted on accompanying the expedition in spite of the
      most strenuous efforts on the part of the savages in red coats to shake
      them off; whereas Brock had just held a formal council with the Indians,
      and regularly arranged the terms of alliance. Two years later, when peace
      was being negotiated, the British commissioners spoke of these Indians,
      not as an irresponsible force, but as regular allies, who must share in
      the treaty.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Hull gave a defiant reply, ordered McArthur and Cass to return at
      once with their detachment, and made admirable arrangements to defend the
      place. In the afternoon there was an artillery duel between two
      twenty-four pounders in the fort and a British battery at Sandwich on the
      opposite side of the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brock's force, according to his own testimony, numbered 1330 men,
      including 600 Indians, and he had also two ships of war. Hull had present
      for duty about 1000 men. * Brock sent a large body of Indians across the
      river that night, at a point five
    </p>
    <p>
      * It is impossible to reconcile the conflicting statements as to the
      numbers on either side.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">036</span><a name="link036" id="link036"></a>miles
      below the fort, and early in the morning crossed with the remainder of his
      troops, and at once marched on the place. Hull had posted his regulars in
      the fort, and his militia in the town, where the stout palings that
      surrounded the little kitchen gardens gave them an admirable shelter. The
      two twenty-four pounders were loaded heavily with grape and placed so as
      to command the road by which the enemy was approaching, in close order,
      twelve deep. Never was there a better opportunity to do wholesale
      execution by a single discharge. Everybody was watching in breathless
      expectation to see the match applied and the murderous iron go surging
      through those beautiful ranks, when, to the astonishment cf friend and foe
      alike, a white flag was hung out upon the wall of the fort. Brock himself
      was surprised, when, sending to know what it meant, he learned that Hull
      had determined to surrender. The articles of capitulation were drawn up,
      and the American general surrendered not merely the fort and its garrison,
      but the whole Territory of Michigan, of which he was Governor. Thus ended
      this miserable campaign.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hull's officers were incensed at his action, and he was subsequently
      court-martialled, convicted of cowardice, and condemned to death; but the
      President pardoned him, in consideration of his <span class="pagenum">037</span><a
      name="link037" id="link037"></a>age and his services in the Revolution.
      The points of his defence were: that an army in a situation like his, cut
      off from its supplies, must surrender sooner or later; that if he had
      given battle, it would have exposed all the inhabitants of the Territory
      to Indian barbarities; that his situation was the fault of the
      Administration, rather than his own; that his force was inferior to
      Brock's; and that his provisions were nearly exhausted. Benedict Arnold
      himself was hardly held in greater contempt by the American people than
      was General Hull for years after his trial. Many believed him to be more
      traitor than coward. This state of feeling was largely due to Colonel
      Lewis Cass&mdash;nearly forty years later a candidate for the Presidency&mdash;who
      hurried to Washington with the news, and greatly exaggerated the
      circumstances that bore against Hull. Cass's action in this matter was
      exceedingly discreditable. On one point, the important question of
      supplies, a letter written by him two days before the surrender was flatly
      contradicted by his testimony at the trial. Subsequent investigations, if
      they do not exonerate General Hull, have at least greatly modified the
      blame attached to him.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he great Indian
      leader, Tecumseh, cherished a design similar to that of Pontiac in the
      previous century. He wanted to unite all the northwestern tribes in an
      effort to drive the white man out of the country, or at least out of the
      Northwestern Territory. For the prosecution of this design the disasters
      which the Americans had sustained in the fall of Michilimackinac, Fort
      Dearborn, and Detroit seemed an auspicious opening, and Tecumseh
      endeavored to follow it up promptly with attacks on the other frontier
      posts held by United States troops. The most important of these were Fort
      Wayne, on the present site of Fort Wayne, Indiana, and Fort Harrison, on
      the Wabash, above Terre Haute.
    </p>
    <p>
      A force of Kentuckians had been gathered in August and placed under
      command of General William Henry Harrison, afterward President of the
      United States, destined for the reënforcement of <span class="pagenum">039</span><a
      name="link039" id="link039"></a>Hull at Detroit. But after the news of his
      surrender, it was directed to the relief of Fort Wayne, to reach which
      required a long march through the wilderness of western Ohio. A journal
      kept by one of the soldiers on this march, Elias Darnell, is still extant.
      It contains many amusing and suggestive anecdotes. Under date of September
      5th he says: "General Harrison, having paraded the remaining part of the
      army in a circle in close order, delivered a speech to them, stating that
      he had just received intelligence from Fort Wayne; that it was in great
      danger of being taken by the Indians and British; he said that we were
      under the necessity of making a forced march to their relief. He read some
      of the articles of war, and stated the absolute necessity of such
      regulations and restrictions in an army, and if there were any who could
      not feel willing to submit to those articles and go on with him, they
      might then return home. One man, belonging to Colonel Scott's regiment,
      made a choice of returning home, rather than submit to those terms. Some
      of his acquaintances got a permit to escort him part of the way home. Two
      of them got him upon a rail and carried him to the river; a crowd followed
      after; they ducked him several times in the water, and washed away all his
      patriotism." The danger from firearms in the hands of undisciplined volun<span
      class="pagenum">040</span><a name="link040" id="link040"></a>teers is
      shown by these passages: "One of Captain McGowen's company was
      accidentally shot through the body by one of the sentinels." "A man was
      accidentally shot through the head by one of the mounted riflemen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "One of the light horsemen wounded a man as he was feeding his horse,
      believing him to be an Indian." The privations of such an expedition are
      well illustrated by this: "We marched through some first-rate woodland,
      and through a prairie of the best quality. It is badly watered; the water
      in the wagon-ruts was the only drink we could get to cool our scorching
      thirst, and but very little of that." And the romantic incidents by this:
      "The tomb of a chief was discovered; it was built on the ground with
      timber and clay, so that no rain or air could enter. The chief was laid on
      his blanket, his head toward sunrise, his rifle by his side, his tin pan
      on his breast, with a spoon in it; he was ornamented in their style, with
      ear-rings, brooches, etc."

      Fort Wayne, which was well provisioned and had a garrison of about seventy
      men, commanded by Captain Rhea, was besieged by the Indians for two weeks.
      A portion of General Harmar's expedition had been defeated by the savages
      on this spot twenty-two years before. The fort now had four small
      field-pieces, and was otherwise well equipped. <span class="pagenum">041</span><a
      name="link041" id="link041"></a>The Indians at first professed to be
      friendly, and tried by all means to surprise the garrison. Then they
      mounted logs to look like siege guns. But the wary Captain Rhea was not to
      be deceived, and on the approach of Harrison's expedition, September 12th,
      the besiegers decamped. Their villages and cornfields in the neighborhood
      were destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fort Harrison was less fortunate than Fort Wayne. It was commanded by
      Captain Zachary Taylor, who was afterward President of the United States.
      His force was very small, and had been reduced by sickness to about
      fifteen effective men. On the 3d of September two young settlers were
      killed and scalped near the fort by Indians. The next day thirty or forty
      of the savages appeared with a white flag, asked for admission to the
      fort, and wanted something to eat. Taylor had been warned to expect an
      attack, was on his guard, and refused to open the gates. Near midnight a
      block-house which formed part of the outer line of fortifications was
      found to be on fire. The crowd of savages outside was now swelled to
      several hundreds, and what with their horrible yelling and the cries of
      nine women and children inside the fort, and the rapidly spreading flames,
      the little garrison was thrown into considerable confusion. The
      destruction of the block-house would open a gap through which the <span
      class="pagenum">042</span><a name="link042" id="link042"></a>Indians would
      quickly pour in a swarm, and then woe to the little band of whites! But
      Captain Taylor never lost his coolness for a moment. He ordered the part
      of the roof of the barracks which was nearest to the fire to be thrown
      down, and the end of the barracks kept wet. The invalids and convalescents
      manned the two bastions and the other blockhouse, and kept up a fire on
      the Indians, to protect the men who were at work on the roof. This fight
      against a double foe was kept up for eight hours; and the garrison not
      only prevented the fire from spreading, but erected a temporary breastwork
      to cover the gap made by the destruction of the blockhouse, and thus
      completely foiled the Indians, who disappeared next day, driving off as
      many as possible of the cattle belonging to the neighboring farmers. Of
      the garrison, two men were killed and two wounded. For this skilful and
      gallant action, Taylor was made a major. A passage in his official report
      of the affair is interesting, not as having any bearing on the result, but
      because by detailing the experience of two individuals it gives us a vivid
      idea of the manner in which such contests were conducted. He says: "One
      man lost his life by being too anxious; he got into one of the galleys in
      the bastions, and fired over the pickets, and called out to his comrades
      that he had killed an Indian, and <span class="pagenum">043</span><a
      name="link043" id="link043"></a>neglecting to stoop down, in an instant he
      was shot dead. One of the men that jumped the pickets returned an hour
      before day, and, running up toward the gate, begged for God's sake for it
      to be opened. I suspected it to be a stratagem of the Indians to get in,
      as I did not recollect the voice; I directed the men in the bastion, where
      I happened to be, to shoot him, let him be who he would; and one of them
      fired at him, but fortunately he ran up to the other bastion, where they
      knew his voice, and Dr. Clark directed him to lie down close to the
      pickets, behind an empty barrel that happened to be there, and at daylight
      I had him let in. His arm was broke in a most shocking manner, which he
      says was done by the Indians&mdash;which I suppose was the cause of his
      returning. The other they caught about one hundred and thirty yards from
      the garrison, and cut him all to pieces."
    </p>
    <p>
      Fort Madison, which had been built in an exposed and badly chosen
      situation on the bank of the Mississippi, near the site of St. Louis, was
      attacked on the 5th of September by more than two hundred Indians,
      Winnebagos. They approached stealthily, caught one of the garrison outside
      of the fort, and shot and scalped him within sight of his comrades on the
      walls. Firing was kept up on both sides for two days, but with little
      effect. On the 7th the sav<span class="pagenum">044</span><a name="link044"
      id="link044"></a>ages displayed on poles the head and heart of the man
      they had killed, and later in the day tried to destroy the buildings by
      shooting upon the roofs arrows to which they had tied combustible matter
      and set it on fire. As at Fort Harrison, the appearance of fire created a
      panic among the men; but the commander, Lieutenant Hamilton, was equal to
      the occasion. He ordered eight old gun-barrels to be made into syringes,
      and small holes to be broken through the roof from the inside. Thrusting
      up the syringes through these holes, the men were able in a few minutes to
      make the roof as wet as if a heavy shower had fallen, which completely
      baffled the design of the enemy. On the 8th the Indians took possession of
      an old stable near the fort, and renewed the fight; but a few cannon-shot
      were sent crashing through the stable, while the gun-barrel syringes did
      duty as before, and the savages then withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides these actions at the forts, there were numerous encounters between
      small parties of white men and Indians, in which often great skill and
      courage were displayed. One of the most noteworthy was Colonel Ball's
      fight. That officer was descending the bank of Sandusky River with
      twenty-two mounted men, when a party of Indians about equal to their own
      numbers fired upon them from <span class="pagenum">045</span><a
      name="link045" id="link045"></a>ambush. Ball and his men charged into the
      ambuscade, drove out the savages, and killed the chiefs. Ball was
      dismounted, and struggling with a gigantic chief, when one of his men came
      up and shot the Indian. The remaining Indians then became furious, and
      gave the signal for no quarter. Ball's men understood the situation, and
      fought without flinching, till they had killed every one of their
      antagonists. This affair had a wholesome effect upon the Indians of that
      region, and for some time the settlers were unmolested.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>ull's surrender by
      no means put an end to the design of invading Canada, but neither did it
      have any effect in changing the vicious plan of striking the enemy on the
      wrong flank.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the night of September 20th, Captain Benjamin Forsyth embarked at Cape
      Vincent, New York, with about a hundred men, and in the morning landed
      near the village of Gananoqui, Canada. Here an engagement took place with
      about an equal number of British troops&mdash;regulars and militia&mdash;at
      the close of which the enemy fled, leaving ten men dead on the field and
      several wounded and prisoners. Captain Forsyth then burned the military
      storehouse&mdash;which was the object of his expedition&mdash;paroled the
      captured militia, and returned to the American shore with a few regulars
      as prisoners of war and a considerable quantity of arms and ammunition.
      One man of his party had been killed. <span class="pagenum">047</span><a
      name="link047" id="link047"></a>In retaliation, the Canadians fitted out a
      much more formidable expedition against Ogdensburg. It consisted of about
      seven hundred and fifty men, who on the 2d of October embarked in forty
      boats, and under the escort of two gunboats moved up the St. Lawrence. At
      the same time, the British batteries at Prescott, opposite Ogdensburg,
      opened fire on that place, which was returned by an American battery. The
      next day was spent in preparations, and in the forenoon of Sunday, the
      4th, the final embarkation was made from Prescott, in twenty-five boats
      and the two gunboats. As a blind, they proceeded up the river past
      Ogdensburg for some distance. Then suddenly they turned about and bore
      down upon that place, while at the same instant the British batteries
      reopened fire on the village. The American battery, together with a
      company of riflemen, all under command of General Jacob Brown, reserved
      fire till the flotilla was within point-blank range, and then opened all
      at once, the fire was returned, and kept up steadily for an hour. Two of
      the boats were so damaged that they had to be abandoned, and another, with
      its crew, was captured. The expedition then returned to Prescott without
      having effected a landing on American soil.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the surrender of Detroit was included the brig-of-war <i>Adams</i>,
      which left the Americans with no <span class="pagenum">048</span><a
      name="link048" id="link048"></a>naval force whatever on the upper lakes.
      Lieutenant Jesse D. Elliott, of the navy, was sent to Buffalo to organize
      a flotilla, and soon after a detachment of sailors to man it was ordered
      thither from New York. In October the <i>Adams</i>, which the British had
      renamed <i>Detroit</i>, and a smaller vessel, the <i>Caledonia</i>, which
      had taken part in the capture of Michilimackinac, came down Lake Erie, and
      cast anchor near Fort Erie. Elliott formed a plan for their capture, and
      with a force of fifty sailors and fifty soldiers embarked in boats at
      midnight of the 8th. They rowed silently across the river, and before they
      were discovered leaped upon the decks of the vessels, secured the crews,
      weighed anchor, and headed for the American shore. As the wind was too
      light to carry them up stream, they were obliged to run down past the
      British batteries. The <i>Caledonia</i>, which had a valuable cargo of
      furs, was run ashore at Black Rock and secured. The <i>Detroit</i> fought
      the enemy's batteries while unsuccessful efforts were made to tow her
      beyond their reach. Finally she drifted ashore at Squaw Island, where her
      captors abandoned her, taking away their prisoners. A party of British
      soldiers subsequently boarded her, but were driven off by fire from a
      battery. In the course of the day she underwent a heavy fire from both
      sides, and in the evening a British party were <span class="pagenum">049</span><a
      name="link049" id="link049"></a>preparing to recover her, when they were
      anticipated by an American party who boarded her and set her on fire. For
      this exploit, in which half a dozen of his men were killed, Congress gave
      Lieutenant Elliott a vote of thanks and a sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      These comparatively trifling incidents of border war were succeeded by one
      much more serious, though not more effective. In the summer General
      Dearborn had entered into an armistice with Sir George Prevost, the
      British commander in Canada, which set free the enemy's troops on the
      Niagara frontier, who were promptly moved against Hull at Detroit. That
      campaign being finished, a large part of them was drawn back to the line
      of the Niagara, and when in the autumn a movement in that quarter was
      contemplated by the Americans, they were confronted by a considerable
      force at every point where a crossing was possible, while General Brock,
      the victor of Detroit, was on the ground, commanding the whole, and ready
      to concentrate them at any point that might be attacked. He expected the
      crossing to take place at the mouth of the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Stephen Van Rensselaer, commanding all the forces on the American
      side of the Niagara, determined to cross from Lewiston, at the foot of the
      rapids, seven miles below the great Falls, and seize Queenstown. The
      importance of the place arose <span class="pagenum">050</span><a
      name="link050" id="link050"></a>from the fact that it was the terminus of
      the portage between Lake Ontario and the upper lakes. At this point the
      high ground through which the great Chasm of the river below the Falls has
      been cut slopes down to a lower plateau, on which stands the village of
      Queenstown.
    </p>
    <p>
      The British had one piece of artillery on the Heights, south of the
      village, and another on the bank of the river a mile below. It was
      believed by many that General Van Rensselaer, who had been a prominent
      Federalist, was opposed to the war and purposely delayed moving against
      the enemy. Whether this was true or not, the discontent with his tardiness
      was so loudly expressed and had begun so to demoralize his troops, that at
      last he acknowledged himself compelled by it to move. He had minute
      information as to the situation and strength of each post of the enemy on
      the western bank of the river, and could choose his own point for
      crossing. He had about six thousand troops under his command&mdash;regulars,
      volunteers, and militia. The immediate command of the attacking force was
      assigned to his cousin, Lieutenant-Colonel Solomon Van Rensselaer, which
      occasioned serious dissatisfaction, because he was only an officer of New
      York militia, while some of the officers who had been ordered to join the
      expedition were commissioned in <span class="pagenum">051</span><a
      name="link051" id="link051"></a>the United States regular army, and
      therefore ranked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirteen large boats, capable of carrying 340 men, with their equipments,
      were brought on wagons and launched at Lewiston on the 10th of October,
      and arrangements were made for crossing before daylight the next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night a cold, northeast storm set in, and the troops, who were
      promptly brought to the rendezvous, stood shivering for hours in the rain
      and darkness, on the river-bank, waiting for the boats, which, did not
      come. At length day dawned, and the crossing had to be postponed. It
      afterward appeared that the boats had been intrusted to one Lieutenant
      Sims, who was said to have taken them up the river, far beyond the point
      at which they were wanted, and then abandoned the expedition. No
      sufficient motive has ever been assigned for this extraordinary conduct on
      the part of the lieutenant. It has been suggested that he was so incensed
      at seeing the command given to an officer of militia, that he was willing
      to destroy his own reputation, if he had any, for the sake of frustrating
      the movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days later the attempt was renewed. Three hundred regulars under
      Lieutenant-Colonel John Chrystie, and an equal number of militia under
      <span class="pagenum">052</span><a name="link052" id="link052"></a>Colonel
      Van Rensselaer, were to cross the river before daybreak of the 13th, and
      storm the Heights of Queenstown, and the remainder of the troops to follow
      and reenforce them. Lieutenant-Colonel Winfield Scott arrived from Buffalo
      on the evening of the 12th, and asked leave to join the expedition, but
      was refused. Yet he placed a battery on Lewiston Heights, to protect the
      troops while they were crossing.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was still cold and stormy when the embarkation took place. All the
      regulars and a few of the militia crossed, and ten of the boats returned
      for a second load. The other three boats, in one of which was Chrystie,
      had missed their way in going over.
    </p>
    <p>
      A force of the enemy, under Captain Dennis, moved down promptly to resist
      the landing, and some of the Americans were killed or wounded before they
      stepped on shore. Captain John E. Wool, being the senior officer present,
      assumed the command, and quickly moved his troops up the bank, where they
      formed in line at the foot of the Heights. The enemy was reenforced almost
      at the same time, and attacked the Americans in front and on the right
      flank with artillery and musketry. Wool stood his ground, though he had no
      artillery, and a short but bloody fight ensued. Of the ten officers of
      regulars, two were killed, and four, including Wool himself, <span
      class="pagenum">053</span><a name="link053" id="link053"></a>severely
      wounded. The left wing was composed of the militia. There the fighting was
      less severe, but Lieutenant-Colonel Van Rensselaer was so seriously
      wounded that he was obliged to withdraw from the contest and recross the
      river. The steady and well-directed fire of Wool's men drove the enemy's
      left wing back into the village; but his right wing, stationed on the
      Heights, was unmoved. Annoyed by the fire from that quarter, the Americans
      fell back to the river-bank to re-form, and were soon reenforced by
      another company of regulars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Receiving leave, rather than orders, from Van Rensselaer to capture the
      Heights, Wool placed the fresh troops on his right, and set out upon the
      task, while Lieutenant Lush followed in rear of the column, with orders to
      shoot down any man who faltered. Wool first moved his command southward
      along the water's edge, the bank sheltering them from the sight of the
      enemy, and then at the point where the gorge of the river made a sharp
      edge, as it were, to the Heights began the ascent, still out of sight of
      the battery-men. In many places the pathway was so steep and rugged that
      the soldiers had to use their muskets like alpenstocks, and climb by
      seizing the bushes, and "boost" one another. Wool was foremost in the
      scramble, and near the top found a fisherman's path which led to the
      plateau, <span class="pagenum">054</span><a name="link054" id="link054"></a>and
      had been left unguarded because it was supposed to be impassable. By this
      path they gained the Summit, and silently filed out upon the plain to the
      rear and right of the British battery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile General Brock, hearing the sounds of battle, had ridden up
      rapidly from Fort George at the mouth of the river, and now stood near
      this battery, watching the operations below. A sudden volley of musketry
      in the rear startled him, and the appearance of Wool's column rushing down
      upon the battery caused him to retreat down the slope without waiting to
      mount his horse, followed by his staff and the artillerymen, and their
      entire infantry support. When the sun rose, a few minutes later, it shone
      upon the American flag floating over the captured works.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brock sent orders to General Sheaffe at Fort George to bring up
      reënforcements, and at the same time to open an artillery fire on Fort
      Niagara, on the opposite bank; for the British commander had been all the
      while of opinion that the movement on Queenstown was but a feint, and that
      the real attack would be made at the mouth of the river. Without waiting
      for the reënforcements. Brock placed himself at the head of the troops
      that had just been driven from the Heights, and the troops in the village,
      and attempted to recapture the lost position. As the <span class="pagenum">055</span><a
      name="link055" id="link055"></a>assaulting force moved up the slope, it
      bore to the west, to envelop the left flank of the Americans. Wool sent a
      detachment to check this movement; but his men were too few, and his whole
      command was forced back till it stood with a powerful enemy in front and a
      precipice behind it. At this point of time, a captain raised a white
      handkerchief on the point of a bayonet; but in an instant Wool tore it
      down with his own hands, and then, addressing a few inspiriting words to
      his men, he persuaded them to re-form their somewhat broken ranks, and
      keep up a steady and effective fire. When their ammunition was nearly
      exhausted, they made a gallant bayonet charge which drove the enemy down
      the slope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brock rallied his troops for another assault, received a few
      reënforcements, and was just setting the column in motion when a bullet
      struck his breast and he fell mortally wounded. His troops, now under
      command of Lieutenant-Colonel McDonell, rushed forward with the cry of
      "Revenge the General!" but to no purpose. Wool's little band stood firm,
      and drove back the enemy once more with serious loss, McDonell being
      mortally wounded, and the two officers next in command disabled, while ten
      men and an Indian Chief remained with the Americans as prisoners. The
      troops who had <span class="pagenum">056</span><a name="link056"
      id="link056"></a>accomplished this gallant feat were recruits who had
      never seen service before, and their leader, now but twenty-three years of
      age, had not received a military education, but was a bookseller and then
      a law-student, until commissioned as a captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      About ten o'clock reënforcements were sent over to Wool, and
      Lieutenant-Colonels Winfield Scott and John Chrystie, and General William
      Wadsworth, soon followed them. The last-named officer, who was in plain
      clothes, modestly made known his rank, but insisted that the command
      should be assumed by Scott, whom he heartily and efficiently supported. *
      Wool was now, from loss of blood, obliged to withdraw from the field.
      Scott had about six hundred men&mdash;three hundred and fifty regulars and
      two hundred and fifty militia. He placed them in position to repel any
      attack of the enemy, and at the same time to cover the crossing of the
      remaining militia, which was to be sent over to him at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this time General Roger H. Sheaffe was hurrying up from Fort George
      with troops, in obedience to the orders sent to him by Brock in the
      morning. He arrived on the field, and was ready for action
    </p>
    <p>
      * He was uncle of General James S. Wadsworth, who was killed in the battle
      of the Wilderness in 1864.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">057</span><a name="link057" id="link057"></a>about
      two o'clock. His entire force consisted of about thirteen hundred soldiers
      and five hundred Indians.
    </p>
    <p>
      The militia on the American shore could overlook the field of battle, and
      saw the approach of Sheaffe. But when General Van Rensselaer attempted to
      move them across the river to the support of their victorious but
      hard-pressed countrymen, they refused to stir. The law provides that
      militia shall not be compelled to serve beyond the bounds of the State
      against their will; the men fell back upon this privilege, and all
      entreaty was in vain. This action&mdash;or non-action&mdash;on the part of
      the militia has subjected them to severe censure, and has uniformly been
      attributed to pure cowardice. But while it was probably not altogether
      justifiable, there were some circumstances, not generally mentioned, which
      partially excuse it. For instance, they knew that, through gross
      mismanagement, all the boats, except one small scow, had been allowed to
      float off down the current or be captured by the enemy; and hence if they
      crossed it must be by a small boatload at a time, instead of in a body.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of this disappointment, Scott resolved to make the best fight he
      could with what troops he had. The first attack was made on his left flank
      by the Indians, who were commanded by John Brant, <span class="pagenum">058</span><a
      name="link058" id="link058"></a>a son of the Joseph Brant of Revolutionary
      fame. This attack Scott repelled with gallant bayonet charges; but when
      about four o'clock Sheaffe moved up his whole force, and doubled back the
      right flank, the Americans were obliged to retreat. A few let themselves
      down the precipice, clambering from ledge to ledge and bush bush to bush,
      but when they reached the water's edge there were no boats to receive
      them. The greater part retreated a short distance along the road leading
      from Queenstown to the Falls; but seeing escape was impossible, they
      surrendered in a body. To do this, they had to send a flag of trace
      through the line of Indians, and it was three times fired upon before it
      finally reached the British commander. The last time it was borne by Scott
      in person.
    </p>
    <p>
      So fended the battle of Queenstown, which was a very remarkable action,
      and with better management might have had a different termination. General
      Van Rensselaer, in his official despatches, labored to create the
      impression that the refusal of the militia to cross the stream was the
      whole cause of the final disaster, and at the same time he studiously
      avoided mentioning the names of the officers&mdash;Wool and Scott&mdash;to
      whom was due the credit for all the successes and glory of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Americans, in this series of engagements, <span class="pagenum">059</span><a
      name="link059" id="link059"></a>lost about ninety men killed, a hundred
      wounded, and nearly a thousand taken prisoners. The British loss has never
      been determined. The American prisoners were sent to Quebec, where
      twenty-three Irishmen were separated from the others and sent to England
      to be tried for treason, on the ground that they were British subjects and
      had been fighting against their own flag. As soon as the American
      authorities had an equal number of prisoners in their possession they
      placed them in close confinement, and gave notice that their fate would be
      determined by that of the twenty-three Irishmen. People who know nothing
      of historical experience in such matters always cry out against any
      proposal of retaliation, arguing that it will simply result in the murder
      of all the prisoners on both sides. As a matter of fact, when retaliation
      is promptly and firmly threatened for violation of the laws of war, it
      always has the effect of stopping the outrage. And so it proved in this
      case; for twenty-one of the captured Irishmen lived to return to their
      adopted country. The other two died in prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the funeral of General Brock, minute guns were fired by the
      Americans on the eastern bank of the river, "as a mark of respect to a
      brave enemy." There was perhaps no harm in this little bit of sentiment,
      though if the Americans remembered that <span class="pagenum">060</span><a
      name="link060" id="link060"></a>two months before, in demanding the
      surrender of Detroit, General Brock had threatened to let loose a horde of
      savages upon the garrison and town, if he were compelled to capture it by
      force, they must have seen that their minute guns were supremely
      illogical, not to say silly. Brownell, in one of his best poems, expresses
      the true sentiment for such a case:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      "The Muse would weep for the brave,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      But how shall she chant the wrong?
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      When, for the wrongs that were,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Hath she lilted a single stave?

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hile the year 1812
      brought nothing but disaster to the land forces of the United States, on
      the ocean it was fruitful of victories that astonished the world. It is
      greatly to the credit of President Madison that he followed the advice of
      Captains Stewart and Bainbridge, in opposition to his entire Cabinet, to
      develop and use the navy, instead of laying it up. That was not only the
      wise but the appropriate thing to do. This was pre-eminently a sailors'
      war, entered upon chiefly for the purpose of protecting American seamen
      from impressment in a foreign service, and its ultimate result would be a
      settlement of the question whether American ships were to be at liberty to
      sail the high seas at all, or whether, as a poet of our day puts it, the
      Atlantic Ocean was to be considered merely John Bull's back yard. It was
      the wise thing to do, because, if a na<span class="pagenum">062</span><a
      name="link062" id="link062"></a>tion determines to go to war at all, it
      should do it in earnest; and the most effective war is made when the
      earliest and most persistent blows are directed at the enemy's vital part.
      Of all Great Britain's possessions that could be reached by balls or
      bayonets, her ships at sea were the most important to her. Canada might be
      overrun, or even conquered, and she would hardly feel its loss&mdash;or at
      least she could exist without it; but anything that weakened her navy and
      deranged her commerce would make every Englishman feel the penalties of
      war.
    </p>
    <p>
      A slight foretaste of what American seamanship and gunnery might do had
      been afforded by an affair that took place a year before the war broke
      out. The American frigate <i>President</i>, of forty-four guns, with
      Commodore John Rodgers on board, was cruising off Sandy Hook in May, 1811,
      searching for an English frigate that had taken a sailor from an American
      brig, when she sighted a strange craft. In answer to her hail, the
      stranger fired a shotted gun, and the shot struck the mainmast. The <i>President</i>
      promptly returned the fire, and in a few minutes broadsides and musketry
      blazed out from both vessels. As soon as Rodgers perceived the inferiority
      of his antagonist, he ordered his gunners to cease firing; but no sooner
      were his guns silent than the stranger opened again. With another
      broadside or <span class="pagenum">063</span><a name="link063" id="link063"></a>two
      the <i>President</i> completely crippled her, and then hailed and got an
      answer. As darkness now came on, Rodgers lay to for the night, keeping
      lights displayed, in case the stranger should need assistance. In the
      morning he sent an officer on board, who learned that she was the British
      ship Little Belt; that she was badly damaged, and had lost thirty-one men
      killed or wounded. But she declined receiving any assistance. On board the
      President one boy had been slightly wounded. Each vessel sailed for home,
      and each commander told his own story, the two accounts being widely
      different. The version here given is that of the American officers.
      According to the English captain, the <i>President</i> began the action by
      firing a broadside into the unoffending <i>Little Belt</i>. Each
      government accepted the statement of its own officers, and there the
      matter rested.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was this same vessel, the <i>President</i>, that fought the first
      action of the war. With news of the declaration came orders to Commodore
      Rodgers, then in New York, to sail on a cruise against the enemy. Within
      one hour he was ready. The <i>Hornet</i>, of eighteen guns, Captain
      Lawrence, was ready at the same time, and the <i>Essex</i>, of thirty-two
      guns, Captain Porter, a few hours later.
    </p>
    <p>
      Information had been received that a large fleet of English merchantmen
      had left Jamaica, under <span class="pagenum">064</span><a name="link064"
      id="link064"></a>a strong convoy, for England, and on the 21st of June,
      Rodgers left the port of New York with his squadron, in search of them. He
      did not find them; but on the morning of the 23d a sail appeared in sight,
      which proved to be the British frigate <i>Belvidera</i>, and the <i>President</i>
      gave chase. About four o'clock in the afternoon the vessels were within
      gunshot, and Rodgers opened fire with his bow-guns, sighting and
      discharging the first one himself. The ball struck the rudder-coat of the
      <i>Belvidera</i>, and passed into the gun-room. The next shot struck the
      muzzle of one of her stern-chasers. The third killed two men and wounded
      five. At the fourth shot the gun burst, blowing up the forecastle deck, on
      which Rodgers was standing, and hurling him into the air. The explosion
      also killed or wounded sixteen men. This caused a lull in the action, and
      the <i>Belvidera's</i> men went back to their guns and returned the fire
      with considerable effect. The <i>President</i> soon began to forge ahead,
      when the <i>Belvidera</i> cut loose her anchors, stove her boats and threw
      them overboard, started fourteen tons of water, and thus lightened,
      managed to escape, and a few days afterward made the port of Halifax. The
      total loss of the <i>President</i>, killed and wounded, in this action,
      was twenty-two; that of the <i>Belvidera</i>, about half as many. <span
      class="pagenum">065</span><a name="link065" id="link065"></a>An English
      privateer was captured by the <i>Hornet</i> on the 9th of July, and
      subsequently seven merchantmen, and an American vessel that had been
      captured by the enemy was retaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the <i>Belvidera</i> carried into Halifax the news of the declaration
      of war, and that the American cruisers were out, a squadron of five
      vessels, under Captain Vere Broke in the <i>Shannon</i>, was sent out to
      destroy Rodgers. They did not find him, but they captured several American
      merchantmen off the port of New York, and also took, after a smart chase,
      the little brig-of-war <i>Nautilus</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Essex, which had left port a little later than the <i>President</i>
      and <i>Hornet</i>, took several prizes, one of them being a transport
      filled with soldiers. She was chased by the <i>Alert</i>, of twenty guns,
      and fired upon. The <i>Essex</i> was armed with carronades, guns not
      intended for work at long distances. Waiting till the enemy had come
      pretty near, she suddenly opened her broadside, and in eight minutes the
      <i>Alert</i> struck her colors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great war-game on the ocean began in earnest when Captain Isaac Hull
      sailed from the Chesapeake in July, in the <i>Constitution</i>, a frigate
      of forty-four guns. On the 17th he came in sight of five vessels, which
      proved to be Broke's squadron, and the next day he was surrounded by them.
      As the wind was <span class="pagenum">066</span><a name="link066"
      id="link066"></a>very light, he resorted to "kedging" to keep out of reach
      of them. This consisted in sending a boat ahead for perhaps half a mile,
      with a kedge anchor and lines. The kedge was then dropped, and the lines
      carried back to the ship. These being fastened to the windlass, the crew,
      by turning it and winding them up, pulled the vessel up to the anchor.
      While this was being done, the boat was going ahead with another kedge and
      lines, to repeat the operation and make it continuous. The flagship of the
      British squadron was pretty close in chase when the American frigate was
      thus seen to be walking away from it. The enemy soon found out how the
      mysterious movement was made, and resorted to the same expedient. But it
      was not possible to approach very near by this means, as it would have
      brought his boat under the fire of the American's stern-guns. Captain Hull
      had cut away some of the woodwork and run two twenty-four pounders out at
      his cabin windows, and also mounted a long gun on his spar deck as a
      stern-chaser. Whenever there was a little wind, every vessel set every
      stitch of canvas she could carry, and all the nicest arts of seamanship
      were resorted to to gain the slightest advantage. Eleven ships were in
      sight most of the time, all participating in the contest. An American
      merchantman appeared to windward, and the British vessels, <span
      class="pagenum">067</span><a name="link067" id="link067"></a>not wishing
      to leave the chase, displayed an American ensign to decoy her within reach
      of their guns. Thereupon the <i>Constitution</i> hoisted an English flag,
      to warn her off. This exciting race was kept up for three days. In the
      evening of the second day, it was evident that a heavy squall was coming
      up. Just before it struck the <i>Constitution</i>, all the light canvas
      was furled, and the ship was brought under short sail in a few minutes.
      When the pursuing vessels observed this, they began at once to let go and
      haul down without waiting for the wind. Presently the squall came, and
      with it a rainstorm that hid the vessels from one another. As soon as this
      happened, the <i>Constitution</i> sheeted home and hoisted her fore and
      main topgallant sails, and while her pursuers were steering in different
      directions to avoid the force of the squall, and believed her to be borne
      down by the pressure of the wind, she was sailing straight away from them
      at the rate of eleven knots an hour. When the squall was over, the nearest
      vessel of the British squadron was seen to be a long way astern, and to
      have fallen off two points to leeward, while the slowest ones were so far
      behind as to be almost out of sight. The chase was kept up during the
      night, but in the morning was found to be so hopeless that it was
      abandoned.
    </p>
    <p>
      This contest, though a mere race, attended with <span class="pagenum">068</span><a
      name="link068" id="link068"></a>no fighting, no damage of any kind, and
      only a negative result, is famous in the annals of the ocean. It was a
      fine instance of that superior seamanship which stood the American sailor
      in good stead throughout the war, and contributed quite as much as his
      valor to the brilliant victories that rendered Great Britain no longer the
      mistress of the seas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hull made sail for Boston, and after a short stay in that port sailed
      again on the 2d of August. He cruised along eastward as far as the Gulf of
      St. Lawrence, where he captured and burned two small prizes, and then
      stood southward. In the afternoon of the 19th a sail was descried from the
      masthead, and the <i>Constitution</i> at once gave chase. Within an hour
      and a half she was near enough to the stranger to see that she was a
      frigate; and a little later she laid her maintopsail aback and waited for
      the <i>Constitution</i>, evidently anxious for a contest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hull immediately put his vessel in complete trim for a fight, cleared for
      action, and beat to quarters. At five o'clock the English frigate, which
      proved to be the <i>Guerriere</i>, of thirty-eight guns, Captain Dacres,
      hoisted three ensigns and opened fire. The <i>Constitution</i> approached
      cautiously, so as to avoid being raked, firing occasionally, but reserving
      most of her guns for close action.
    </p>
    <p>
      After an hour of this, the <i>Guerriere</i> indicated her <span
      class="pagenum">069</span><a name="link069" id="link069"></a>readiness for
      a square fight, yard-arm to yard-arm, and the <i>Constitution</i> set her
      sails to draw alongside. The fire from both ships became gradually
      heavier, and in ten minutes the mizzen-mast of the <i>Guerriere</i> was
      shot away. The <i>Constitution</i> then passed slowly ahead, keeping up a
      constant fire, her guns being double shotted with grape and round shot,
      and attempted to get a position across the bows of the enemy and rake her.
      But in trying to avoid being herself raked while gaining this position,
      she luffed short, and fell foul of her enemy. At this moment the cabin of
      the <i>Constitution</i> took fire from the flash of the <i>Guerriere's</i>
      guns, and for a while it looked as if she would fare hardly. But by the
      energy and skill of Lieutenant B. V. Hoffman, who commanded in the cabin,
      the fire was extinguished, confusion prevented, and a gun of the <i>Guerriere</i>
      that might have repeated the mischief disabled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The instant the vessels came together, each attempted to board the other;
      but a close and deadly fire of musketry prevented. On the American side,
      Lieutenant Morris, Master Alwyn, and Mr. Bush, Lieutenant of Marines,
      sprang to the taffrail to lead their men, when they were all shot down.
      Finding it impossible to board, the <i>Constitution</i> filled her sails
      and shot ahead, and a moment later the <i>Guerriere's</i> foremast fell,
      and carried the mainmast, with it. This <span class="pagenum">070</span><a
      name="link070" id="link070"></a>reduced her to a wreck, and as a heavy sea
      was on she was helpless. The <i>Constitution</i> hauled off a short
      distance, repaired damages, and at seven o'clock wore round and took a
      position for raking. An ensign that had been hoisted on the stump of the
      mizzen-mast was at once hauled down in token of surrender, and the prize
      was won. A lieutenant sent on board returned with the news that she was
      one of the squadron that had so lately chased the <i>Constitution</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The victor kept near her prize through the night, and at daylight the
      officer in charge reported that the <i>Guerriere</i> had four feet of
      water in the hold and was in danger of sinking. Captain Hull therefore
      transferred the prisoners to his own vessel, recalled the prize crew, and
      set the wreck on fire. In fifteen minutes the flames reached the magazine,
      and the hulk that still remained of the proud English frigate was blown to
      pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this battle the <i>Constitution</i> lost seven men killed and seven
      wounded. Her rigging suffered considerably, but her hull was only very
      slightly damaged. The <i>Guerriere</i> lost seventy-nine men killed or
      wounded. The location of this battle may be found by drawing a line
      directly east from the point of Cape Cod, and another directly south from
      Cape Race; the point of intersection will be very near the bat<span
      class="pagenum">071</span><a name="link071" id="link071"></a>tle-ground.
      It is a little south of the track of steamers between New York and
      Liverpool.
    </p>
    <p>
      The news of this victory was a startling revelation, on both sides of the
      Atlantic. In expressing their contempt for the American navy, the English
      journals had especially ridiculed the <i>Constitution</i>, as "a bunch of
      pine boards, under a bit of striped bunting." This bunch of boards had now
      outsailed a squadron of eleven British war-vessels, and in a fight of half
      an hour had reduced one of their frigates to a wreck and made her strike
      her colors. It was true that the American ship was slightly superior in
      number of men and guns; but this would not account for the superiority of
      seamanship, the better gun-practice, and the enormous difference in
      losses. Captain Dacres, who was afterward put on trial for losing his
      ship, asserted that he had sent away a considerable number of his men in
      prizes; that he had several Americans in his crew who refused to fight
      against their countrymen, and that he permitted them to go below. But all
      allowances that could be made did not change the essential character of
      the victory. Only a short time before, the London Courier had said, "There
      is not a frigate in the American navy able to cope with the <i>Guerriere</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Hull, who was now in his thirty-eighth year, had entered the navy
      at the age of twenty<span class="pagenum">072</span><a name="link072"
      id="link072"></a>three, and had gained distinction in the war with
      Tripoli. When he landed in Boston with his prisoners, nearly the whole
      population of the town turned out to greet him. Flags and streamers were
      displayed on every hand, decorated arches spanned the streets, and a
      banquet was spread for him and his crew. He made a sort of triumphal
      progress to New York and Philadelphia, where similar honors were paid him,
      and handsome swords and snuffboxes presented to him. Congress voted him a
      gold medal, to each of his commissioned officers a silver medal, and fifty
      thousand dollars to the crew as prize money.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his official report the Captain said: "It gives me great pleasure to
      say that, from the smallest boy in the ship to the oldest seaman, not a
      look of fear was seen. They all went into action giving three cheers, and
      requesting to be laid close alongside the enemy." The London <i>Times</i>
      said: "It is not merely that an English frigate has been taken, after what
      we are free to confess may be called a brave resistance, but that it has
      been taken by a new enemy, an enemy unaccustomed to such triumphs, and
      likely to be rendered insolent and confident by them. He must be a weak
      politician who does not see how important the first triumph is, in giving
      a tone and character to the war. Never before in the <span class="pagenum">073</span><a
      name="link073" id="link073"></a>history of the world did an English
      frigate strike to an American; and though we cannot say that Captain
      Dacres, under all circumstances, is punishable for this act, yet we do say
      there are commanders in the English navy who would a thousand times have
      rather gone down with their colors flying than have set their brother
      officers so fatal an example."
    </p>
    <p>
      The next naval contest, in the order of time, was that of the <i>Wasp</i>
      and the <i>Frolic</i>, one of the bloodiest of the war. The <i>Wasp</i>,
      an American sloop-of-war, of eighteen guns, commanded by Captain Jacob
      Jones, was a very fast sailer, and had gone to Europe with despatches,
      when the war broke out. On her return she was refitted with all haste and
      sent out on a cruise. In the night of October 17th, about five hundred
      miles off Cape Hatteras, she sighted a fleet of six English merchantmen
      under convoy of the <i>Frolic</i>, a brig, of twenty-two guns, Captain
      Whinyates. Four of the merchantmen were armed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, the sea being somewhat rough, the <i>Wasp</i> was put
      under short canvas and got into fighting trim, and then bore down upon the
      <i>Frolic</i>, which kept herself between her convoy and the enemy. She
      also was under short canvas, and her main-yard was on deck. About half
      past eleven o'clock the <i>Wasp</i> came up close on the starboard side of
      the <i>Frolic</i>, and broadsides were exchanged at <span class="pagenum">074</span><a
      name="link074" id="link074"></a>the distance of only sixty yards. The fire
      of the Englishman was the more rapid, but that of the American was the
      more deliberate and effective. In a little over four minutes the <i>Wasp's</i>
      maintopmast was shot off and with the maintopsail-yard fell across the
      braces, rendering the head-yards unmanageable. A few minutes later her
      gaff and mizzen-topgallant-mast were shot down; and before the action was
      over, every brace and most of the rigging was carried away. The shot of
      the <i>Wasp</i> was directed mainly at her enemy's hull, and the firing on
      both sides was kept up with great spirit, little or no attempt being made
      to manoeuvre, and the vessels gradually approaching each other. At last
      they were so near that the American gunners touched the side of the <i>Frolic</i>
      with their rammers, her bowsprit passed over the <i>Wasp's</i>
      quarterdeck, and the latter was brought directly across the Englishman's
      bows, in position for raking. Captain Jones ordered a broadside; and when
      it was fired, the muzzles of two of the guns were actually in the bow
      ports of the <i>Frolic</i>, and the discharge swept her from stem to
      stern.
    </p>
    <p>
      As no sign of submission had come from the enemy, Captain Jones was about
      to repeat the raking, but was prevented by the impetuosity of his crew. A
      sailor named John Lang, who had once <span class="pagenum">075</span><a
      name="link075" id="link075"></a>been impressed on a British man-of-war,
      hot for revenge, sprang upon the bowsprit of the <i>Frolic</i>, cutlass in
      hand, and was followed by Lieutenant Biddle and an impromptu
      boarding-party. They met no opposition. Two or three officers, wounded and
      bleeding, were standing on the after-part of the deck; there was a
      cool-headed old seaman at the wheel; and dead and wounded sailors were
      lying about in all directions. The officers threw down their swords, and
      Lieutenant Biddle sprang into the rigging and hauled down the British
      flag. The battle had lasted forty-three minutes. On board the <i>Wasp</i>,
      five men had been killed and five wounded. The loss on the <i>Frolic</i>
      has never been ascertained, it was at least seventy-five. Captain
      Whinyates, in his official report, said that not twenty of his men escaped
      injury.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two vessels were separated, and in a few minutes both masts of the <i>Frolic</i>
      fell. Arrangements were made for sending her into Charleston with a prize
      crew, while the Wasp should repair damages and continue her cruise. But
      before this plan could even be fairly entered upon, the British
      ship-of-the-line <i>Poictiers</i>, carrying seventy-four guns, hove in
      sight, and speedily made prize of both vessels and took them to Bermuda.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the same day when this action took place. <span class="pagenum">076</span><a
      name="link076" id="link076"></a>Commodore Stephen Decatur, cruising in the
      frigate <i>United States</i>, captured the British packet <i>Swallow</i>,
      which had on board a large quantity of specie. He continued his cruise
      eastward, and only a week later (October 25th), at a point about midway
      between the Azores and the Cape Verd Islands, sighted a large vessel to
      windward, which proved to be the English frigate <i>Macedonian</i>,
      carrying forty-nine guns, Captain Carden. She was somewhat smaller than
      the <i>United States,</i> and had fewer men. Decatur made up to the
      stranger; but she had the advantage of the wind, and for some time managed
      to keep out of reach. At length, after considerable manoeuvring, the
      distance was shortened, and both vessels opened fire with their long guns.
      The gunnery of the American was superior, and while sustaining little
      injury herself she inflicted serious damage upon her antagonist. At the
      end of half an hour, the distance had been still more diminished, so that
      the carronades were brought into use. A carronade is a short gun, throwing
      a comparatively large ball with not very great velocity. The size of the
      ball and its slower motion cause it to splinter and tear a ragged hole in
      the side of a ship, where a smaller shot with a greater velocity would
      pass through and make a smooth round hole, which could easily be plugged
      up again. <span class="pagenum">077</span><a name="link077" id="link077"></a>As
      the <i>Macedonian</i> became disabled, she fell off to leeward, while the
      United States passed ahead and to windward, and then tacked and came up
      under her lee. The firing, which had been entirely with artillery, now
      ceased on both sides. The <i>Macedonian's</i> mizzen-mast was gone, her
      main and foretopmasts carried away, her main-yard cut in two, and her
      ensign had disappeared. The <i>United States</i> hailed her, and was
      answered that she had struck her colors. She had received a hundred shot
      in her hull, most of them in the waist. She went into the action with
      three hundred men, of whom she lost thirty-six killed and sixty-eight
      wounded. On board were seven impressed American sailors, two of whom were
      killed. On the <i>United States</i> five men were killed and seven
      wounded. Her rigging was considerably cut, but otherwise she received very
      little injury.
    </p>
    <p>
      Decatur took his prize to New York, going in by way of Long Island Sound,
      where he arrived on New Year's day, 1813. He was received with a great
      ovation, and there were banquets, orations; and public rejoicings
      unlimited. Congress, following the precedent set in the case of Hull,
      voted a gold medal to the commander, and a silver one to each of his
      commissioned officers.
    </p>
    <p>
      A member of the British Parliament, making a <span class="pagenum">078</span><a
      name="link078" id="link078"></a>speech concerning this affair, said he
      "lamented that, with the navy of Great Britain against that of America,
      which consisted of only four frigates and two sloops, two of our finest
      frigates were now in their possession, captured by only two of theirs.
      This was a reverse which English officers and English sailors had not
      before been used to, and from such a contemptible navy as that of America
      had always been held, no one could suppose such an event could have taken
      place."
    </p>
    <p>
      And the London <i>Independent Whig</i> was constrained to say: "A powerful
      and rival nation is now rapidly rising in the west, whose remonstrances we
      have hitherto derided, but whose resentment we shall soon be taught to
      feel; who for our follies or our crimes seems destined to retaliate on us
      the miseries we have inflicted on defenceless and oppressed states, to
      share with us the fertile products of the ocean, and snatch from our
      feeble and decrepit hands the imperial trident of the main."
    </p>
    <p>
      But the cup of English humiliation was not yet full. The Americans had
      another able commander, with a stanch ship and a fearless crew, who now
      came in for his turn. This was Commodore William Bainbridge, who sailed
      from Boston late in October, on board the <i>Constitution</i>, the same
      vessel with which Hull had conquered the <i>Guerriere</i>. In com<span
      class="pagenum">079</span><a name="link079" id="link079"></a>pany with her
      sailed the brig <i>Hornet</i>, of eighteen guns, commanded by Captain
      James Lawrence.
    </p>
    <p>
      They cruised southward, and in December the <i>Hornet</i> was left at San
      Salvador, or Bahia, Brazil, to blockade an English brig that was on the
      point of sailing with a large amount of specie on board. Lawrence had sent
      in a challenge to fight the two brigs, on even terms, just outside the
      harbor, but the English captain declined.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Constitution</i> continued her cruise, and on the 29th, off the
      Brazilian coast, sighted the English frigate <i>Java</i>, carrying
      thirty-eight guns, Captain Lambert. Bainbridge tacked and drew the
      stranger off the land, which was not more than thirty miles distant, and
      when far enough away stood toward him. The enemy seemed quite as anxious
      for a contest, and about two o'clock it began. The firing was heavy and
      continuous. The <i>Java</i> had the advantage of the wind, and attempted
      to cross the <i>Constitution's</i> bow, to rake her. But the latter wore,
      and avoided it. This manoeuvre was repeated several times, and at length
      the <i>Constitution</i>, though her wheel had been shot away, making it
      difficult to manage the steering-gear, succeeded in getting the coveted
      position, and raked her antagonist.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Java, which had been badly damaged, ran down Upon the <i>Constitution</i>
      with the intention of <span class="pagenum">080</span><a name="link080"
      id="link080"></a>boarding. But her jibboom became entangled in the <i>Constitution's</i>
      mizzen-rigging, and she was held there and raked mercilessly. At this time
      her bowsprit and foremast were shot away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two vessels now separated, and after considerable manoeuvring came
      together again, yard-arm and yard-arm, and reopened their broadsides. Now
      the <i>Java's</i> mizzen-mast tumbled, and her main-mast was the only
      stick left standing. The <i>Constitution</i> then hauled off, and spent an
      hour in repairing damages, at the end of which time she wore round and
      stood across her antagonist's bow, when the English colors were struck.
    </p>
    <p>
      The action had lasted an hour and fifty-five minutes. The <i>Constitution</i>
      had lost nine men killed and twenty-five wounded, Commodore Bainbridge
      being slightly wounded. The loss on board the <i>Java</i> was variously
      stated; the lowest estimate made it twenty-two killed and one hundred and
      one wounded. Bainbridge said that sixty were killed. Captain Lambert was
      mortally wounded. The whole number on board was four hundred, including
      General Hislop and his staff and other officers, who were on their way to
      the East Indies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Java</i> was a complete wreck, and after a day or two it was
      determined to blow her up, which was done after all the prisoners and
      wounded had been <span class="pagenum">081</span><a name="link081"
      id="link081"></a>carefully removed. She might have been towed into Bahia;
      but Brazil was friendly to Great Britain, and Bainbridge did not want to
      trust his prize in a Brazilian harbor. He, however, landed his prisoners
      there, and paroled them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Constitution</i>&mdash;which received the name of "<i>Old Ironsides</i>,"
      on account of escaping serious damage in this action&mdash;arrived at
      Boston in February. Here the same welcome that had been given to Hull and
      Decatur was extended to Bainbridge. The cities of New York and Albany gave
      him gold snuff-boxes, Philadelphia gave him a service of silver, and
      Congress voted the usual medals, with fifty thousand dollars of prize
      money for the crew.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first six months of the war, the little American navy, for which
      Congress had done nothing, and from which nothing had been expected, had
      six encounters with English cruisers, and in every one was victorious.
      These defeats were a sore trouble to English naval historians, who have
      ever since been laboring to explain them away. They have invented all
      sorts of ingenious theories to account for them; but it has never occurred
      to them to adopt the simple explanation that they <i>were</i> defeats,
      brought about by superior seamanship and gunnery, backed up by the
      consciousness of a just cause, on the part of the Americans. The favorite
      explanation <span class="pagenum">082</span><a name="link082" id="link082"></a>has
      been, that the American so-called frigates were seventy-four-gun ships in
      disguise; that the English crews were all green hands, and their numbers
      were not full at that. A few years later, General Scott met at a dinner in
      London a young British naval officer, who superciliously inquired,
      "whether the Americans continued to build line-of-battle ships, and to
      call them frigates."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have borrowed a great many excellent things from the mother country,"
      answered Scott, "and some that discredit both parties. Among the latter is
      the practice in question. Thus when you took from France the <i>Guerrière</i>,
      she mounted forty-nine guns, and you instantly rated her on your list a
      thirty-six-gun frigate; but when we captured her from you, we found on
      board the same number, forty-nine guns!"
    </p>
    <p>
      During this same half year, nearly three hundred British merchantmen had
      been captured and brought into American ports. In this work the little
      navy had been assisted by a large number of privateers, which had sailed
      from our ports, under letters of marque, and had not only helped
      themselves to the rich spoils of British commerce, but had occasionally
      fought with armed cruisers.
    </p>
    <p>
      These disasters were no more than had been predicted by Lord Nelson, the
      greatest of English admirals. After watching the evolutions of an Ameri<span
      class="pagenum">083</span><a name="link083" id="link083"></a>can squadron
      commanded by Commodore Richard Dale, in the bay of Gibraltar, he is
      reported to have said to an American gentleman who was on board his
      flagship that "there was in those transatlantic ships a nucleus of trouble
      for the maritime power of Great Britain. We have nothing to fear from
      anything on this side of the Atlantic; but the manner in which those ships
      are handled makes me think that there may be a time when we shall have
      trouble from the other."

      <i>Winchester's Expedition&mdash;Fight at Frenchtown&mdash;Massacre at the
      Raisin&mdash;Siege of Fort Meigs.</i>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>t the opening of
      the year 1813, General William Henry Harrison, who had won a high
      reputation by his victory over the Indians at Tippecanoe in 1811, being
      now in command of the forces in the West, endeavored to concentrate them
      for a movement against the British and savages at Detroit and Malden. An
      expedition composed mainly of Kentucky troops, under General James
      Winchester, was making its way northward through Ohio to join him; and
      Leslie Coombs, of Kentucky, accompanied by a single guide, went through
      the woods more than a hundred miles on foot to inform Harrison of their
      approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Winchester's expedition reached the rapids of the Miami, he was met
      by messengers from the pioneers about the River Raisin, informing him that
      the enemy was organizing a movement against the settlements there, and
      imploring him to protect them. A detachment of six hundred and sixty men,
      <span class="pagenum">085</span><a name="link085" id="link085"></a>under
      Colonels Lewis and Allen, was sent forward, and pushing on with the
      greatest possible rapidity, marching a part of the way over the frozen
      surface of Lake Erie, reached Frenchtown, on the Raisin, where Monroe,
      Michigan, now stands, on the 18th of January.
    </p>
    <p>
      That place had been occupied a few days before by a hundred English and
      four hundred Indians, who now took the alarm and prepared to resist the
      advancing expedition. As he approached the village, Colonel Lewis formed
      his command in columns, and moved forward in the face of a heavy fire of
      musketry and artillery. The enemy was posted behind the houses and garden
      fences of the village, which stood on the north side of the river; and the
      Americans, who had no artillery, crossed over on the ice and at once made
      a charge. Finding themselves attacked vigorously in front and on the left
      flank at the same time, the British retreated about half a mile, and took
      a new position in the woods, where they were partly protected by fallen
      timber. Colonel Lewis sent a detachment to strike this position on its
      right flank; and as soon as he heard the firing there, Colonel Allen
      attacked it in front. The enemy retreated slowly, fighting at every step,
      and the Americans steadily pressed their advantage till dark, when they
      returned to the village and en<span class="pagenum">086</span><a
      name="link086" id="link086"></a>camped. They had lost twelve men killed
      and fifty-five wounded. The loss of the enemy was not ascertained, but
      they left fifteen men dead on the field where the first engagement took
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The news of this victory was sent at once to General Winchester, who came
      up promptly with a reënforcement of two hundred and fifty men. It was
      expected that the place would be attacked by a heavier British force from
      Malden, which was but eighteen miles distant, and preparations were made
      for constructing a fortified camp. But the enemy came before this could be
      completed. In the night of January 21st, Colonel Henry Proctor, with a
      force of about eleven hundred, British and savages, moved from Malden, and
      early in the morning of the 22d the American sentries were surprised. No
      pickets had been thrown out, and the troops were hardly brought into line
      when a heavy fire of artillery and small arms was opened, both in front
      and on the flanks, the yells of the savages being heard in the intervals
      of the discharges.
    </p>
    <p>
      The attack in front was met and repelled by a steady fire, the Americans
      being considerably sheltered by the stout garden fences. On the right
      flank the attack was not so well resisted, and that wing was soon broken.
      It was rallied by Winchester, and reenforced by Lewis; but the enemy,
      seeing his ad<span class="pagenum">087</span><a name="link087" id="link087"></a>vantage,
      followed it up, and the whole wing, reenforcements and all, was swept
      away, the remnant retreating in disorder across the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      All efforts to rally the fugitives were vain, and in a little while the
      Indians overwhelmed the left wing also. The disorganized troops of this
      wing attempted to escape by a road that led to the rapids of the Raisin;
      but the savages were posted all along behind the fences, and shot down
      great numbers of them. They then took to the woods directly west of the
      village; but here also were savages lying in wait, and it is said that
      nearly a hundred were tomahawked and scalped before they had gone as many
      yards. One party of nearly twenty men surrendered, but all except the
      lieutenant in command were at once massacred by their treacherous captors.
      Another party of forty were overtaken after they had retreated three
      miles, and compelled to surrender, when more than half of them were
      murdered in cold blood. General Winchester and Colonel Lewis were captured
      by the Indians, but Proctor, with some difficulty, got them under his
      protection. Colonel Allen, after trying without success to rally his men,
      retreated alone nearly two miles, and there sat down on a log, being too
      much enfeebled by wounds to go farther. An Indian chief came up and
      demanded his surrender, promising protection; but <span class="pagenum">088</span><a
      name="link088" id="link088"></a>almost immediately followed two others,
      who evidently intended to scalp him. Allen killed one of them with a
      single blow of his sword, and was immediately shot by the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the centre of the American line could not be dislodged from its
      position behind the fences. It was composed of Kentucky sharpshooters, and
      some idea of the havoc they made among the British regulars may be gained
      from the fact that out of sixteen men in charge of one gun thirteen were
      killed. Appalled at such losses, Proctor bethought him of a cheaper method
      than continued fighting. He represented to General Winchester, now a
      prisoner in his hands, that unless an immediate surrender were made, the
      result would be a complete massacre of the Americans. Winchester's fears
      were so wrought upon that he sent, by a flag of truce, orders to Major
      Madison to surrender. As he had no right to give orders of any kind while
      a prisoner in the hands of the enemy, Madison refused to obey, but offered
      to surrender on condition that safety and protection should be guaranteed
      to him and his men. When Proctor found he could not get the place in any
      other way without a great sacrifice of his troops, he agreed to the terms
      proposed, and the surrender took place.
    </p>
    <p>
      But no sooner had the gallant little band become <span class="pagenum">089</span><a
      name="link089" id="link089"></a>prisoners, than Proctor, like many other
      British officers of that day, forgot his promise, and the savages began to
      plunder the prisoners, unhindered by their English allies. Thereupon the
      Americans resumed their arms, and by a vigorous bayonet charge drove off
      the Indians.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day the British force started for Malden, taking with it all the
      prisoners who were able to march. The badly-wounded were left at
      French-town, with no guard but a British major and the interpreters. The
      injured men were taken into the houses, and attended by two American
      surgeons. On the morning of the 23d, about two hundred Indians who had
      accompanied Proctor as far as Stony Creek, and there had a carouse,
      returned to French-town, held a council, and resolved to kill all the
      prisoners who could not march away with them. They then proceeded at once
      to plunder the whole village, tomahawk the wounded men, and set fire to
      the houses. They perpetrated such outrages and cruelties that most of the
      historians have shrunk from detailing them. Many prisoners who managed to
      crawl out of the burning buildings were thrown back into the flames. A few
      of the strongest were marched off with the savages toward Malden; but as
      one by one they became exhausted, they were mercilessly tomahawked and
      scalped. These scalps <span class="pagenum">090</span><a name="link090"
      id="link090"></a>were carried to the British headquarters, where the
      savages received the premium for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the American force engaged in this affair, three hundred and
      ninety-seven were killed, five hundred and thirty-seven were prisoners,
      and but thirty-three escaped. The British are said to have lost
      twenty-four killed and a hundred and fifty-eight wounded. The loss of the
      Indians is unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the disaster at the River Raisin, General Harrison concentrated his
      remaining troops&mdash;twelve hundred men&mdash;and built Fort Meigs, at
      the foot of the rapids of the Maumee. This work was on the right bank of
      the stream, on high ground, and enclosed about eight acres. There were
      several strong block-houses, and considerable artillery.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Proctor, with a force of about one thousand British and twelve
      hundred Indians, and two gunboats, set out on an expedition against this
      post in April. He crossed the lake, ascended the river, and on the 28th
      landed about two miles below the fort, but on the opposite bank. Here he
      erected a battery, and subsequently he planted two others, above the fort
      but on the left bank, and one below and very near it on the right bank.
      The Indians, commanded by the famous Tecumseh, were landed on the right
      bank, to invest the fort in the rear. The batteries opened fire on the 1st
      of May, and <span class="pagenum">091</span><a name="link091" id="link091"></a>kept
      it up steadily four days; but it had very little effect, owing largely to
      a traverse twelve feet high and twenty feet thick which the garrison had
      constructed while the batteries were being erected. Proctor on the third
      day demanded a surrender, with the usual threat of massacre.
    </p>
    <p>
      Learning that General Green Clay was coming to him with a reënforcement of
      eleven hundred Kentuckians, Harrison had sent word to him to hurry forward
      as fast as possible. At midnight on the 4th of May, two officers and
      fifteen men from this force descended the river and entered the fort, with
      the news that Clay was but eighteen miles distant. Harrison sent orders to
      him to send eight hundred of his men across the river at a point a mile
      and a half above the fort, thence to march down the left bank and capture
      and destroy the enemy's batteries; the remaining three hundred to march
      down the right bank and fight their way through the Indians to the fort.
    </p>
    <p>
      The detachment landed on the left bank, commanded by Colonel Dudley, moved
      silently down upon the British batteries, and then, raising a terrific
      yell, were upon them before the enemy could realize that he was attacked.
      The guns were spiked and their carriages destroyed; but instead of
      crossing to the fort at once, as Harrison's orders direct<span
      class="pagenum">092</span><a name="link092" id="link092"></a>ed, the
      victors, flushed with their success, were drawn into a running fight with
      some Indians, and finally fell into an ambush, and all but about a hundred
      and fifty were either captured or killed. That number reached their boats
      and crossed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The detachment on the right bank, under General Clay himself, had some
      difficulty in landing, and lost a few men in fighting its way through the
      Indians, but ultimately reached the fort. While these movements were going
      on, three hundred and fifty men of the garrison, under Colonel John
      Miller, made a sortie against the battery on the right bank, captured it,
      spiked the guns, and returned with forty-three prisoners.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Clay's troops reached the fort, they were joined by another sallying
      party, and the combined force moved against the Indians, whom Tecumseh
      commanded in person, and drove them through the woods at the point of the
      bayonet. Tecumseh attempted to move a force of British and Indians upon
      their left flank and rear, to cut off their return to the fort, but this
      movement was frustrated by Harrison, who understood Indian warfare quite
      as well as the great chief himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Proctor's savage allies, disgusted at his want of success, now began to
      desert him, and he was obliged to raise the siege and retreat. This he did
      <span class="pagenum">093</span><a name="link093" id="link093"></a>not do,
      however, without keeping up his reputation for treachery and cold-blooded
      cruelty. His prisoners were taken to old Fort Miami, a short distance down
      stream, where the savages were allowed to murder more than twenty of them.
      Captain Wood, an eye-witness, says: "The Indians were permitted to garnish
      the surrounding rampart, and to amuse themselves by loading and firing at
      the crowd, or at any particular individual. Those who preferred to inflict
      a still more cruel and savage death selected their victims, led them to
      the gateway, and there, under the eye of General Proctor, and in the
      presence of the whole British army, tomahawked and scalped them." It is
      said that the horrible work was stopped by Tecumseh, who, coming up when
      it was at its height, buried his hatchet in the head of a chief engaged in
      the massacre, crying: "For shame!&mdash;it is a disgrace to kill a
      defenceless prisoner!" "In this single act," says the witness who narrates
      it," Tecumseh displayed more humanity, magnanimity, and civilization than
      Proctor, with all his British associates in command, displayed through the
      whole war on the northwestern frontiers."
    </p>
    <p>
      The total loss to the Americans in these actions was eighty-one men
      killed, two hundred and sixty-nine wounded, and four hundred and
      sixty-seven made prisoners. It is uncertain what the British <span
      class="pagenum">094</span><a name="link094" id="link094"></a>loss was, but
      it was probably somewhat smaller than that of the Americans.
    </p>
    <p>
      In July, Proctor and Tecumseh, with a combined English and savage force of
      about five thousand, returned to Fort Meigs and attempted to draw out the
      garrison by strategy; but Harrison was, as usual, too shrewd for them, and
      they turned their attention to Fort Stephenson. This was an oblong
      stockade fort, about a hundred yards long and fifty yards wide, with high
      pickets, surrounded by a deep ditch or moat. There was a strong
      block-house at each corner. It was on the Sandusky, where the town of
      Fremont, Ohio, now stands. The garrison consisted of one hundred and sixty
      men, commanded by Major George Croghan.
    </p>
    <p>
      The British sailed around into Sandusky Bay, and up the river, while their
      savage allies marched overland and invested the fort in the rear, to
      prevent the approach of reënforcements. Harrison believed the fort to be
      untenable, and had sent orders to Croghan to abandon and destroy it; but
      these orders did not reach the Major till retreat had become impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 1st of August Proctor sent in a flag of truce, and demanded an
      immediate surrender, accompanied with the usual threat that if it were
      refused the Indians would massacre the entire garrison as <span
      class="pagenum">095</span><a name="link095" id="link095"></a>soon as the
      place was taken. The ensign who met the flag made answer that Major
      Croghan and his men had determined "to defend the fort, or be buried in
      it." Proctor opened fire from his gunboats and four guns which he had
      placed in battery on shore, and bombarded the fort continuously for two
      days and nights. As this fire was directed mainly against the northwest
      angle, Croghan expected the main attack to be made at that point, and
      prepared for it. Besides strengthening the walls with bags of sand and
      bags of flour, he placed his only gun, a six-pounder, where it would
      enfilade the ditch on that side, loaded it with a double charge of slugs,
      and masked it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was after sunset on the 3d when the storming parties approached. Two
      columns passed around the western side of the fort, to threaten the
      southern face, while a third, commanded by a Lieutenant-Colonel Short,
      approached the northwest angle. When it was within twenty yards, the
      Kentucky riflemen gave it a volley that thinned the ranks, but did not
      stop its progress. The Lieutenant-Colonel and a large number of his men
      scaled the outer line of pickets, and poured into the ditch. "Now, then,"
      he shouted, "scale the pickets, and show the d&mdash;&mdash;d Yankee
      rascals no quarter!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The next moment, Croghan's single piece of artil<span class="pagenum">096</span><a
      name="link096" id="link096"></a>lery was unmasked and fired. It completely
      swept the ditch, cutting down nearly every soldier in it, while a volley
      of rifle-balls finished the bloody work. Lieutenant-Colonel Short, who was
      mortally wounded, immediately raised his handkerchief on the point of his
      sword, to ask for quarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another column of red-coats attempted the task at which the first had so
      wofully failed, and the deadly performance of the howitzer and the rifles
      was repeated. The columns that approached the fort on the south were
      driven off by a single volley, and the battle was ended. In the night the
      British gathered up their dead and wounded, and the next morning they were
      seen to sail away, leaving behind a quantity of military stores. They
      acknowledged a loss of twenty-seven killed and seventy wounded; but it was
      probably much larger. One American was killed, and seven wounded.

      <i>The Armaments&mdash;Preliminary Operations&mdash;Expedition against
      York &mdash;Death of General Pike&mdash;Capture of Fort George&mdash;Attack
      on Sackett's Harbor&mdash;Battle of Stony Creek.</i>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he importance of
      the great navigable lakes lying between the United States and Canada had
      not been overlooked by either party to this war. As soon as it broke out,
      both began preparations to secure the ascendency on those waters&mdash;which,
      besides its direct advantages, would be almost necessary to either in
      making invasions around the coasts. A large portion of the shores on both
      sides&mdash;more especially, perhaps, on the American side&mdash;was at
      that time a wilderness, and the few open ports would naturally hold out
      strong temptations to the enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chief advantage was with the British, both because the oldest and
      largest settlements were on their side of the lakes, and because they had
      possession of the St. Lawrence River, which made it easy for them to bring
      up supplies from the seaboard. The Americans, however, had regularly
      trained naval officers in command of their few vessels on <span
      class="pagenum">098</span><a name="link098" id="link098"></a>lakes Ontario
      and Champlain, while the English had not. The largest American vessel on
      the lower lakes was the <i>Oneida</i>, of sixteen guns; the largest
      British vessel, the <i>Royal George</i>, of twenty-two. The enemy also had
      several other vessels, carrying from a dozen to sixteen guns each, which
      it would be useless to specify, as their names and character were several
      times changed during the war. As soon as hostilities were declared, both
      sides began building new ships and arming merchant schooners.
    </p>
    <p>
      In July, 1812, the British fleet had made an attempt to capture the <i>Oneida</i>
      and a prize schooner, both of which were at Sackett's Harbor.
      Lieutenant-Commander Woolsey anchored the <i>Oneida</i> in the harbor,
      where she could command the entrance, placed half of her guns in a battery
      on shore, and easily drove off the enemy's fleet, whose performance
      exhibited very little of the character of serious warfare.
    </p>
    <p>
      In October, of that year, Captain Isaac Chauncey arrived at Sackett's
      Harbor, with authority to organize a fleet. He brought from New York forty
      ship-carpenters and a hundred officers and seamen, and a supply of naval
      stores. He bought ten or a dozen schooners, armed them&mdash;generally
      with long swivel guns&mdash;and fitted them up for naval service as well
      as their character would admit. These, with the <span class="pagenum">099</span><a
      name="link099" id="link099"></a><i>Oneida</i>, carried forty guns and four
      hundred and thirty men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chauncey's first exploit with this fleet was to chase the <i>Royal George</i>
      into the harbor of Kingston, and attack the batteries there; but nothing
      was accomplished by it save the capture of two small prizes. He lost one
      man killed and eight wounded&mdash;five by the bursting of a gun. About
      the same time (November, 1812), an expedition was made to clear the
      Canadian shore of batteries at the head of Niagara River. Four hundred
      soldiers and sailors, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Boerstler and
      Captain King, crossed from Black Rock in twenty boats, assaulted the
      batteries, and after desperate fighting captured them. They then spiked
      all the guns, burned the barracks, and retreated to the shore. The usual
      bad management seems to have entered into this, as into all the other
      enterprises of the sort, and the boats were not at hand for the
      recrossing; in consequence of which Captain King and sixty of his men were
      made prisoners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing can be done on the lakes in winter, as the harbors are closed by
      ice; but the building of vessels went on, and with the opening of spring
      General Dearborn and Commodore Chauncey began operations which showed no
      lack of activity and energy, however well or ill judged they may have
      been. <span class="pagenum">100</span><a name="link100" id="link100"></a>York
      (now Toronto) was at this time the capital ===of Upper Canada. It was a
      place of about twelve hundred inhabitants, situated on a beautiful
      landlocked bay, about two by three miles in extent. The British were known
      to have a large vessel there, the <i>Prince Regent</i>, and to be building
      another. Mainly for the purpose of seizing this vessel, and destroying the
      one on the stocks, General Dearborn planned an expedition against York. He
      had seventeen hundred men available for the purpose, and Commodore
      Chauncey had fourteen vessels.
    </p>
    <p>
      The expedition was organized, and sailed from Sackett's Harbor on the 25th
      of April. The winds were unfavorable, and the passage was somewhat
      tedious; but the fleet arrived off the harbor of York on the 27th. The
      intention was to land the troops by means of boats, at a point about two
      and a half miles west of the town, the guns of the fleet covering the
      landing, and march at once on the defences of the place, where General
      Roger H. Sheaffe was in command. But the water was rough, and the boats
      were driven half a mile farther westward, where they were compelled to
      land with but little protection from the vessels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here a body of British and Indians, concealed in the edge of a wood, were
      ready to receive them.
    </p>
    <p>
      A column of riflemen, under Major Forsyth, were <span class="pagenum">101</span><a
      name="link101" id="link101"></a>in the first boats, and as they approached
      the shore the enemy opened upon them with a destructive fire. Forsyth lost
      a considerable number of men before he could land. But his riflemen stood
      up in the boats and returned the fire with some effect, and he was
      followed quickly by a battalion of infantry under Major King, and this by
      the main body under General Zebulon M. Pike, who was in immediate command
      of the entire military force. The fleet at the same time contrived to
      throw a few effective shots into the woods, and the landing was effected
      without confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The skirmishing party of British and Indians had been gradually
      strengthened till, by the time General Pike's forces were on shore, they
      had an almost equal force to dispute their passage toward the town. The
      enemy were still in the woods, and as soon as the Americans had been
      formed in battle order they advanced. The nature of the ground made it
      almost impossible to move or use their artillery; but the enemy had three
      pieces, with which they attacked the flanks of the column. The fighting
      soon became hot and deadly. There were charges and counter-charges, one
      and another part of either line alternately giving way and rallying again;
      but on the whole the advantage was with the Americans, and the British
      were gradually forced <span class="pagenum">102</span><a name="link102"
      id="link102"></a>back into the outer defences. The Indians are said to
      have fled from the field early in the action.
    </p>
    <p>
      The approach to the town, along the shore, was crossed by numerous streams
      and ravines, and the enemy destroyed the bridges behind them as they
      retired. Two pieces of artillery were with great difficulty taken across
      one of these ravines and placed where they could be brought to bear on the
      enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The orders to the infantry were, to advance with unloaded muskets and
      carry the first battery at the point of the bayonet. This was easily done,
      as the enemy only remained long enough to discharge two or three
      cannon-shots hastily, and then fell back to his second battery, nearer the
      town.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Pike led the column forward at once to the second battery, which
      the enemy also abandoned, after spiking the guns. Here he discovered that
      the barracks, three hundred yards still nearer to the town, appeared to be
      evacuated. Suspecting that there might be some scheme on the part of the
      enemy for drawing him into a disadvantageous position, where a stand would
      be made, he halted at the second battery, and sent forward Lieutenant
      Riddle with a few men to find out the true state of affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lieutenant found the barracks deserted, and was about to return with
      the information, when sud<span class="pagenum">103</span><a name="link103"
      id="link103"></a>denly the ground was shaken by a terrific explosion, and
      in a moment the air was darkened by flying boards, timbers, and stones,
      bars of iron, shells, and shot. The magazine, containing five hundred
      barrels of powder, had been blown up. It was situated in a little ravine,
      the bank of which protected Lieutenant Riddle's party, all of whom
      escaped. But a considerable number of the beams and masses of masonry,
      passing over their heads, fell within the battery. General Pike, who had
      just been removing a wounded prisoner to a place of safety, at the moment
      was seated on a stump, questioning a British sergeant who had been
      captured in the woods. As the shower of débris came down within the
      battery, the General was crushed to the earth by a section of stone wall,
      and two of his aides and the wounded sergeant were also struck down&mdash;all
      of them being fatally injured. By this explosion, fifty-two Americans were
      killed outright, and one hundred and eighty wounded. About forty British
      soldiers also, who were near the magazine, were killed.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Pike being disabled, the command devolved upon Colonel Cromwell
      Pearce, who pushed on with his troops as soon as possible, though not in
      time to prevent the escape of the British General Sheaffe and all his
      regulars who remained unharmed. Sheaffe drew up terms of capitulation, and
      left <span class="pagenum">104</span><a name="link104" id="link104"></a>them
      in the hands of the officer who commanded the militia. As the Americans
      approached the town, they were met by this officer with the offer to
      surrender, the capitulation to include the town and all government stores
      therein. While the parley was going on, Sheaffe destroyed most of the
      military stores, set fire to the war-vessel that was on the stocks, and
      made off, but his baggage and private papers were captured. Two hundred
      and ninety officers and men&mdash;of the British navy and militia&mdash;became
      prisoners and were paroled. General Pike had enjoined upon his soldiers
      the duty of protecting private property in the town, and given orders that
      marauding should be punished with death. His wishes were carefully
      observed; but the government buildings were burned.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Pike, when his wound was found to be mortal, was borne off to the
      fleet. A little while afterward the British flag that had floated over
      York was brought to him. He asked to have it placed under his head, and in
      a few minutes calmly expired. He was but thirty-four years of age, but had
      performed valuable services for his country, especially in the command of
      two exploring expeditions, one about the headwaters of the Mississippi,
      and the other in what is now western Louisiana and Texas&mdash;of both of
      which he published accounts. <span class="pagenum">105</span><a
      name="link105" id="link105"></a>The war-vessel that the Americans expected
      to capture at York had left the harbor two days before their arrival. The
      troops abandoned the place, and on the 1st of May were taken again on
      board the fleet, which as soon as the weather would permit, on the 8th,
      sailed away. In this expedition the loss of the American land forces was
      fourteen killed and twenty-three wounded, besides those who suffered from
      the explosion of the magazine. In the fleet, seventeen men were killed or
      wounded. The British regulars lost sixty-two killed and ninety wounded;
      the loss of the Indians and militia was unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two episodes of this battle have been discussed with considerable warmth.
      The first is the explosion of the magazine. It is not certain that this
      was done purposely. General Sheaffe, in his report, attributed it to "an
      unfortunate accident," but two English historians speak of it with
      commendation as a regularly laid plan. American writers who condemn it
      have done so on the ground that, as the commanding General had made
      arrangements for a surrender, the place was virtually surrendered already,
      and he therefore had no farther right to destroy life or even property.
      Commodore Chauncey probably gave the correct view of the matter when he
      wrote: "I'm much inclined to believe that General Sheaffe was correct when
      he stated that it was accidental. <span class="pagenum">106</span><a
      name="link106" id="link106"></a>Nor could I condemn the enemy, even if a
      train had been laid. It is a perfectly legitimate mode of defence, as
      every student of history knows; and why should we censure the garrison for
      thus employing an acknowledged means of defence, to check the progress of
      an invader?" If the surrender had not virtually taken place, it is
      difficult to see why the defenders of the town are to be any more blamed
      for firing a stone wall at their enemy than they would have been for
      firing a thousand bullets.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other point discussed is the burning of the government buildings. They
      were undoubtedly set on fire, though without orders from headquarters. It
      was said that the soldiers were incensed at finding a human scalp&mdash;presumably
      that of an American, taken by some Indian, and sold to the British
      authorities for the proffered premium&mdash;hanging on the wall of the
      legislative chamber. This scalp and the Speaker's mace were sent to
      Washington, where the British troops found them when they, in turn, burned
      our government buildings a little more than a year later.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Chauncey's fleet left the harbor of York, it sailed due south, and
      landed the troops at a point four miles east from the mouth of Niagara
      River, where they went into camp. From here a small expedition was fitted
      out under Lieutenant Petti<span class="pagenum">107</span><a name="link107"
      id="link107"></a>grew, of the navy, who with a hundred men sailed in two
      schooners to the head of Lake Ontario, to capture a large quantity of
      stores deposited there. They landed on the 10th of May, drove off the
      guard, burned the buildings, and brought away the stores. Chauncey
      himself, with the remainder of the fleet, carried the wounded to Sackett's
      Harbor, whence he returned on the 25th with provisions, guns, and a
      reënforcement of about three hundred and fifty men.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Dearborn immediately planned the capture of Fort George, just
      above the village of Newark, on the western side of the Niagara, two miles
      from its mouth. It was arranged that the troops should be landed on the
      lake shore, and, marching southward and eastward, attack the British works
      from the land side. The enterprise was admirably planned, and brilliantly
      executed. The water at the proposed landing-place was carefully sounded,
      and the stations marked with buoys. A considerable number of boats, to be
      used in landing the forces, had been built on the shore of the river, were
      launched on May 26th, and immediately drew the fire of the enemy's
      batteries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before daylight on the morning of the 27th, the fleet weighed anchor. Five
      of the vessels took positions where they could annoy with a cross-fire the
      <span class="pagenum">108</span><a name="link108" id="link108"></a>batteries
      that were within gunshot of the landing-place. Others took position for
      the immediate protection of the troops, and at the same time Fort Niagara
      opened fire on Fort George, which was returned with spirit. All the
      batteries on the river joined in the contest, and there was a grand chorus
      of artillery firing. The battery immediately opposite Fort George was the
      most effective, and considerably damaged that work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The troops were under the personal command of General Boyd, who had
      succeeded General Pike. With him were many most skilful and efficient
      officers, some of whom afterward became famous. The gallant Major Forsyth
      was there, with his riflemen, and Colonel Macomb with his artillery.
      Winfield Scott, then a colonel, was there, and Captain Oliver Hazard Perry
      had hurried down from Lake Erie, to offer his services and take part in
      the enterprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The preparations for the defence had been quite as well made as those for
      the attack. When the boats loaded with troops approached the shore, a
      column of two hundred men, posted in a ravine, opened a sharp fire on
      them. The fire was returned from the boats, which moved on without
      stopping for a moment or being thrown into any confusion. Captain Hindman,
      of the artillery, was the first man to land on the enemy's coast; and many
      of the <span class="pagenum">109</span><a name="link109" id="link109"></a>officers
      and men were so eager to follow him that they leaped into the water and
      waded ashore.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fire of some of the vessels was brought to bear upon the enemy in the
      ravine; and as soon as the advance column landed, it formed in battle
      order and moved forward to the charge. The enemy soon gave way, but
      retired slowly, and at the same time a second and stronger column, which
      had been posted in another ravine, half a mile in the rear, moved forward
      to protect the retreat of the advance guard and oppose the progress of the
      Americans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every step thus far had been contested, and the roar of cannon and rattle
      of small arms, both on the water and on shore, had been almost incessant
      from the beginning of the engagement. But the bloodiest work was to come.
      The combined columns of British troops, numbering eight hundred or more,
      took a strong position at the top of a steep bank. The advance, under
      Colonel Scott, moved directly against this position; but as his men
      attempted to climb the bank in the face of the enemy, they were
      mercilessly cut down by a sharp and steady fire. Three times they tried to
      reach the top, and three times were driven back. But when Colonel Moses
      Porter's light artillery and a portion of Boyd's brigade had come up to
      his assistance, Scott was at length enabled to carry the height. <span
      class="pagenum">110</span><a name="link110" id="link110"></a>The victory
      at this point decided the day. The flying enemy were pursued as far as the
      village of Newark, at which point Scott detached a force to cut off the
      retreat westward toward Burlington, while with the remainder of his troops
      he pressed on at once to Fort George. This work had been so much damaged
      by the bombardment, and the garrison now left in it was so small, that it
      was easily captured. As Scott approached it, one of the magazines was
      exploded, and a heavy stick of timber struck him and knocked him from his
      horse. Hurrying forward, the soldiers in the advance discovered that
      trains had been laid for the explosion of two other magazines, and they
      were just in time to put out the matches. When the gates of the fort were
      broken open, Scott was the first man to enter, and with his own hands he
      hauled down the British flag. Close behind him was Colonel Moses Porter,
      who could not help exclaiming, "Confound your long legs, Scott, you have
      got in before me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A few prisoners were taken with the fort; but Scott, bent upon making his
      victory complete, made but a brief halt there, and then hurried on his
      forces in pursuit of the retreating enemy. Twice orders were sent to him
      to turn back, and both times he refused to obey them. "Your General does
      not know," said he to a lieutenant who brought one of <span class="pagenum">111</span><a
      name="link111" id="link111"></a>these orders, "that I have the enemy
      within my power; in seventy minutes I shall capture his whole force."
      Colonel Burn, who ranked Scott, but had consented to serve under him, had
      crossed the river with a troop of cavalry, and was waiting for another now
      in midstream, to land, when with his whole force he was to join the
      pursuit. But the fifteen minutes thus lost in waiting enabled General Boyd
      to ride up in person and peremptorily order the pursuit discontinued,
      which of course put an end to it. Just why the General did this&mdash;whether
      he feared the victory might be turned into a disaster, or was only
      apprehensive that Colonel Scott was getting too much glory&mdash;has never
      been explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this action, which was over by noon, the Americans lost one hundred and
      fifty-three men, killed or wounded. The British loss, as nearly as can be
      ascertained, was two hundred and seventy-one killed or wounded, and over
      six hundred unwounded prisoners, five hundred of whom were militia and
      were paroled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The British seized the opportunity while Dearborn and his forces were
      absent on this expedition near the western end of Lake Ontario, to make an
      attack on Sackett's Harbor, at the eastern. The importance of that place
      to the Americans consisted mainly in the fact that they had established
      there a <span class="pagenum">112</span><a name="link112" id="link112"></a>large
      depot of naval and military stores, and were building ships.
    </p>
    <p>
      The expedition sailed from Kingston in four war-vessels, a brig, two
      schooners, and two gunboats, all under command of Sir James Lucas Yeo. The
      land forces, commanded by General Prevost, numbered about a thousand,
      besides a party of Indians, said to have numbered three hundred.
    </p>
    <p>
      About noon of the 28th the squadron appeared off Sackett's Harbor, and
      preparations for landing were made. But after the troops had been in the
      boats about half an hour, an order was issued&mdash;for some mysterious
      reason, which has never been explained&mdash;commanding them all to return
      to the ships, which then stood off for Kingston. But while this was going
      on, a fleet of nineteen boats was observed near the south shore, bringing
      American reenforcements from Oswego to the Harbor. The Indians; who
      thought they were there to fight, and could not understand why they should
      return to the ships without firing a gun, disobeyed the order, and paddled
      off to attack the Americans in the boats. The squadron then wore round
      again, and sent out boatloads of troops to the assistance of the Indians,
      who drove ashore and captured twelve of the American boats, after their
      occupants had escaped to the woods. The other seven reached the Harbor.
      <span class="pagenum">113</span><a name="link113" id="link113"></a>This
      little affair inspired the British General with new courage, and he
      resumed the purpose of landing his whole force for an attack on the
      village.
    </p>
    <p>
      But meanwhile the Americans were busily preparing for defence.
      Lieutenant-Colonel Electus Backus, who commanded the remnant of regular
      troops left at the post, had sent word the evening before to General Jacob
      Brown, of the militia, who had been requested by General Dearborn to take
      command in case of an attack during his absence. A militia force numbering
      about five hundred was hastily gathered from the surrounding country, and
      added to the small body of regulars and volunteers, The militia were
      posted behind a ridge of sand which had been thrown up west of the
      village, where their fire would sweep that part of the shore which offered
      the only good landing-place for the enemy. On their right were posted the
      volunteers, with a single piece of artillery. The regulars were formed
      near their camp about a mile distant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in the morning of the 29th the enemy landed. As their boats
      approached the shore, the militia and volunteers rose and fired into them,
      and were fired upon in return by two gunboats that had been sent to cover
      the landing. The enemy's boats then pulled around to the other side of
      Horse Island, which is near the mouth of the harbor, landed, and <span
      class="pagenum">114</span><a name="link114" id="link114"></a>marched
      steadily across the narrow causeway that connects it with the mainland. As
      they approached the ridge, the militia gave them another volley, and then
      fled to the woods, abandoning the piece of artillery. Colonel Mills was
      killed while trying to hold them to their work. General Brown, who was
      borne away with the fugitives, succeeded in rallying about eighty of them,
      whom he posted behind a huge fallen tree, at the edge of a small open
      field. From this cover they gave the still advancing enemy three or four
      volleys, and then retreated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the left of the American line was completely swept away. The right,
      composed of volunteers, gave way more slowly, and retired in good order
      along the shore, skirmishing all the way with the enemy's advance, till
      they reached and formed in line with the regulars. They were annoyed on
      the way by the enemy's gunboats, which swept portions of the road with
      grapeshot; but on the other hand the enemy suffered considerably from the
      fire of their rifles and from parties of regulars sent out by Colonel
      Backus to join in the skirmishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The volunteers took position on the left of the second line of defence.
      The right was occupied by dismounted light dragoons, and the centre by
      regular infantry and artillery. The enemy, elated, as he had cause to be,
      at his first success, came steadily <span class="pagenum">115</span><a
      name="link115" id="link115"></a>on to attack this line, and as he
      approached was subjected to an artillery fire from a small work called
      Fort Tompkins. He struck the right flank of the Americans, but found it
      made of different stuff from militia. Again and again the attempt was made
      to force this part of the line; but the dragoons, commanded by Backus in
      person, stood firm, delivered their fire with coolness, and drove back the
      assailants. The fight was kept up for an hour, and at length the weight of
      numbers told, and the Americans fell back.
    </p>
    <p>
      A portion of them next took possession of the log barracks, and here made
      a third stand. The enemy came on as gallantly as ever, intent upon driving
      everything before him. Colonel Gray, Quartermaster-General, led the
      red-coats, and as they came up to the attack, an American drummer-boy
      picked up a musket, levelled it at the Colonel, and shot him down.
      Lieutenant Fanning, who had been severely wounded at York, and was not
      expected to be on duty, took charge of a gun. As the enemy approached, he
      carefully sighted the piece, and gave them three rounds of grapeshot in
      quick succession, which broke the force of their onset, and they began to
      fall back in some disorder. At this moment Colonel Backus fell mortally
      wounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The officer in charge of the stores had been in<span class="pagenum">116</span><a
      name="link116" id="link116"></a>structed to set fire to them in case the
      enemy seemed likely to capture the place. Seeing the probability of this,
      he now applied the torch, not only to the storehouses but also to a new
      vessel that was almost ready to be launched, and to one that had been
      recently captured from the enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the Americans driven to their last stronghold, and the smoke from
      their burning stores rolling over their heads, the day appeared to be
      irretrievably lost. But though the enemy was strong in good troops,
      gallantly led, he had a weak spot in the constitutional timidity of the
      commander, Sir George Prevost. And General Brown at this point of time
      made a fortunate movement which struck that weak spot in a most effective
      way. He had succeeded in rallying about three hundred of the militia, with
      whom he suddenly emerged from the woods, and made a feint of marching for
      the boats by which the expedition had landed. Sir George took the alarm at
      once, imagining he was to be surrounded by a superior force and entrapped.
      He therefore issued an order for retreat, and his victorious forces
      withdrew to their ships without securing any result of their victory, or
      even bearing off their wounded. A reënforcement of six hundred men, under
      Lieutenant-Colonel Tuttle, who had inarched forty miles in one day,
      reached the vil <span class="pagenum">117</span><a name="link117"
      id="link117"></a>lage just as the enemy were pushing off in their boats.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Americans succeeded in putting out the fires, but not till half a
      million dollars' worth of stores had been destroyed. The new ship was but
      little injured, as her timbers were so green they would not burn readily.
      The prize vessel was on fire, and she had considerable powder in her hold;
      but Lieutenant Talman, at the risk of his life, boarded her, suppressed
      the flames, and brought her off to a place of safety at a distance from
      the burning buildings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir George, not content with making a needless fiasco of his expedition,
      made himself ridiculous by sending a flag of true to demand the surrender
      of the village and the military post, which of course was refused. He then
      sent another flag, asking that his dead and wounded might be properly
      cared for, and on receiving assurances that they would, sailed away with
      the whole fleet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The loss of the Americans in this action was about one hundred and
      seventy, killed, wounded, or missing; that of the British, about two
      hundred and sixty.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days after the loss of Fort George, General Vincent concentrated the
      British forces at Beaver Dams, and retreated westward to Burlington Bay,
      the head of Lake Ontario, where he intrenched him<span class="pagenum">118</span><a
      name="link118" id="link118"></a>self on the heights. General Dearborn,
      after being baffled for some time by false information which Vincent had
      caused to be conveyed to him, at length found out where he had gone, and
      sent the brigades of Winder and Chandler after him. The Americans,
      following the "ridge road" that skirts the whole shore of the lake, came
      up with the enemy's pickets at Stony Creek, a small stream that crosses
      the road at right angles, on the 5th of June. There was considerable
      skirmishing, and the enemy's pickets were driven in.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Chandler, with a wise caution thus far seldom displayed, placed a
      company of artillery at the mouth of the creek, three miles from the road,
      to cover a landing of boats expected there, with the rest of his forces
      took a strong position on the high eastern bank of the creek, where the
      road crosses it, threw out pickets in all directions, gave orders how the
      line should be formed in case of an attack, and ordered that the artillery
      horses be kept harnessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      One regiment at first encamped in the low meadows on the western bank, but
      after nightfall it withdrew to the heights, leaving its camp-fires
      burning, A picket guard that had been posted at a little chapel a quarter
      of a mile in advance was left there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The officer in command of the enemy's rear guard had sent word to General
      Vincent that the Ameri<span class="pagenum">119</span><a name="link119"
      id="link119"></a>cans were in straggling detachments, and if the first
      were attacked at once it could easily be defeated before the others came
      up to its support. The General therefore, as he had little chance of
      further retreat, planned a night attack. A little before midnight of the
      5th he left his camp, at the head of about a thousand men, and marched
      stealthily back by the road he had come, to surprise his foe. The night
      was absolutely dark, and the sentinels at the little chapel were suddenly
      seized and silently bayoneted before they could fire their muskets or make
      any outcry. The assassination of pickets is one of the sickening incidents
      of war that seldom find mention in the reports of the general or the pages
      of the romantic historian, but that cost many a poor fellow his life
      without even the pitiful compensation of what is called glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing the camp-fires in the meadow, with no signs of life among them, the
      British forces imagined that the Americans were all asleep and would fall
      an easy prey to massacre. They advanced confidently, and as they reached
      the deserted fires sprang among them with a hideous yell&mdash;in which
      part of the performance they were materially assisted by a few score
      Indian allies&mdash;expecting to see their foes arise from the ground, and
      rub their eyes open just in time to catch the gleam of the British
      bayonets and <span class="pagenum">120</span><a name="link120" id="link120"></a>savage
      tomahawks before they were buried in American flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of this, while they stood dazed among the waning camp-fires,
      looking about in vain for somebody to massacre, the line on the heights
      blazed out with musketry and artillery, and the shot tore its way through
      the ranks of the red-coats. But the English soldier has always been good
      at obeying orders, and as soon as this volley revealed the whereabouts of
      the Americans, their enemy pressed on in the face of the fire, climbed the
      bank, entered the lines in the darkness, and captured several guns, the
      artillerists not being able to distinguish friend from foe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then began a horrible mêlée, in which nearly every man fought on his own
      account, and many of them could not tell whether they were striking at
      comrades or enemies. Hearing a few shots fired in the rear of his camp,
      General Chandler imagined he was attacked from that direction also, and
      faced about a portion of his line, which increased the dreadful confusion.
      After this wild work in the darkness and tumult, the British managed
      somehow to retreat, carrying off with them two pieces of artillery, which,
      however, were afterward recovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the morning dawned, it was found that the American commanders,
      Chandler and Winder, were <span class="pagenum">121</span><a name="link121"
      id="link121"></a>both prisoners in the hands of the enemy; while the
      British commander, Vincent, had been thrown from his horse, lost his way
      in the woods, and after floundering about all night was discovered in a
      most pitiful and ridiculous plight. Chandler was taken while trying to
      manoeuvre a British regiment, which he had stumbled upon in the darkness
      and mistaken for one of his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this affair the Americans lost one hundred and fifty-four men, killed,
      wounded, or missing; the British, two hundred and fourteen. The victory,
      so far as there was any, must be accorded to the British, since it broke
      the advance of the Americans and caused them to turn back. When they had
      retreated as far as Forty-Mile Creek, they were attacked simultaneously on
      both flanks&mdash;on the land side by a band of Indians, and on the water
      side by the fleet under Sir James Yeo. But they succeeded in repelling
      both enemies, and returned to Fort George with the loss only of a part of
      their baggage, which was conveyed in boats.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this, Yeo coasted along the shore and captured stores in Charlotte,
      at the mouth of the Genesee, and in Sodus, on the bay of that name. As he
      met with some resistance at Sodus, and had difficulty in finding the
      stores, which were hidden, he burned the buildings there. <span
      class="pagenum">122</span><a name="link122" id="link122"></a>There was a
      British depot of supplies at Beaver Dams, about seven miles southwest of
      Queenstown and the same distance northwest of the Falls. General Dearborn
      planned its capture, and on the 23d of June sent against it, from Fort
      George, an expedition of five hundred and seventy men, commanded by
      Lieutenant-Colonel Charles G. Boerstler. The enemy had strong works at
      Beaver Dams, but at this time they were not very well manned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Americans, who had about fifteen miles to march, started in the
      evening, with the intention of surprising and capturing the post in the
      morning. But the enemy had been apprised of the movement, and when the
      Americans reached the present site of Thorold they fell into an ambush,
      where they were suddenly attacked by four hundred and fifty Indians,
      commanded by John Brant (son of the celebrated Mohawk chief, Joseph Brant)
      and Captain Kerr. Though surprised, Boerstler was not confused. He coolly
      but quickly formed his men in battle order, and charged through the woods
      in the direction of the attack. To little purpose, however, as the wily
      savages, following their usual tactics, fled before the line of bayonets,
      and soon attacked the Americans from another direction, firing from the
      thickets and other hiding-places. After keeping up a desultory contest of
      this sort for three hours, with <span class="pagenum">123</span><a
      name="link123" id="link123"></a>no prospect of any termination, Boerstler
      fell back to a position in an open field, encountering on the way a body
      of Canadian militia. Scarcely had he taken this new position, to wait for
      reënforcements which he had asked General Dearborn to send, when a small
      detachment of British regulars approached to reconnoitre. They were
      commanded by a Lieutenant Fitzgibbon, who had been warned of the ap proach
      of the Americans by a woman who had walked nineteen miles to tell him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing that his enemy was somewhat disordered, and not disposed, to take
      the offensive, Fitzgibbon, though he had but forty-seven men, conceived
      the idea of capturing the whole force by one of those tricks which are
      generally supposed to be peculiarly Yankee. Displaying his little
      detachment in such a way as to make it appear to be the advance of a much
      larger body of troops, he sent a flag of truce to Boerstler and boldly
      demanded an immediate surrender, saying that fifteen hundred regulars and
      seven hundred Indians were but a short distance in the rear, and would
      soon come up. For the truth of this he gave his word, "on the honor of a
      British soldier." Boerstler, supposing escape would be impossible,
      surrendered, on condition that his men should be paroled and permitted to
      return to the United States. A Major De Haren, who had been <span
      class="pagenum">124</span><a name="link124" id="link124"></a>sent for in
      all haste by Fitzgibbon, now came up with two hundred additional troops,
      and received the surrender, which included five hundred and forty-two men,
      two guns, and a stand of colors. Major Chapin, who was present, says: "The
      articles of capitulation were no sooner signed than they were violated.
      The Indians immediately commenced their depredations, and plundered the
      officers of their side arms. The soldiers, too, were stripped of every
      article of clothing to which the savages took a fancy, such as hats,
      coats, shoes, etc." The British commander also violated the articles by
      refusing to permit the militia to be paroled, whereupon many of them rose
      upon the guards, overpowered them, and escaped, taking some of the guards
      along as prisoners.
    </p>
    <p>
      This ridiculous affair excited the deepest indignation throughout the
      country; and, in obedience to public sentiment, the President soon removed
      General Dearborn from command.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was hardly more than a fortnight later, July 11th, when
      Lieutenant-Colonel Bisshopp planned an attack on Black Rock, a few miles
      north of Buffalo, where the Americans had a dockyard and large
      storehouses. With about three hundred men, before daylight of July 11th,
      he crossed the river in boats, surprised and took possession of the place.
      <span class="pagenum">125</span><a name="link125" id="link125"></a>and
      proceeded to burn and plunder as rapidly as possible. He set fire to the
      block-houses, the barracks, the navy-yard buildings, and a schooner that
      lay at the wharf, and carried off a considerable quantity of stores. But
      before he could accomplish all this, General Peter B. Porter had got
      together a small force, consisting of regulars, volunteers, militia, and a
      few friendly Indians, and vigorously attacked the invaders. A fight of
      twenty minutes' duration ended in the precipitate retreat of the British,
      who left behind them a captain and nine men killed or wounded, and fifteen
      prisoners. After the boats had pushed off, the Americans renewed their
      fire, by which Bisshopp, commander of the expedition, was killed, and many
      of his men were either killed or wounded. The loss of the Americans was
      three men killed and three wounded. That of the enemy is supposed to have
      been about seventy. They had carried off four guns, besides spiking all
      they left. Bisshopp, who had proved himself an energetic and skilful
      officer, was a serious loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Commodore Chauncey, who was a most meritorious naval commander, though he
      never made a very brilliant reputation, was all this summer trying to
      bring Sir James Yeo to a decisive battle on Lake Ontario; but Sir James
      had a genius for not fighting, and could only be chased to shelter under
      the <span class="pagenum">126</span><a name="link126" id="link126"></a>guns
      of the British forts. It was said also that his instructions forbade his
      fighting except under the most favorable circumstances. Once there seemed
      to be a prospect of a square battle near the mouth of the Niagara, in
      August; but Chauncey's plan was frustrated by the captains of two of his
      schooners, who in disobedience of orders tried to get to windward of the
      British line, and were captured. On the 28th of September there was a
      partial engagement between the two squadrons; but from their unequal
      sailing, it was only possible to bring three of the American vessels into
      action. One of these was badly crippled, but another handled the British
      flagship so severely that she crowded on all canvas and made off, followed
      by the entire fleet, which the Americans could not overtake. On the 5th of
      October Chauncey gave chase to a squadron which proved to be seven British
      gunboats used as transports. One of them was burned, one escaped, and the
      other five were captured, together with more than two hundred and sixty
      men. Two of the prizes were those taken from Chauncey near the Niagara.

      These successes left Lake Ontario virtually in the possession of the
      Americans; and meanwhile the command of Lake Erie had been gained by a
      most brilliant and memorable battle. During the winter <span
      class="pagenum">127</span><a name="link127" id="link127"></a>of 1812-13
      two large brigs, intended to carry twenty guns each, and several gunboats
      and schooners were built at Presque Isle (now Erie, Pa.), where there was
      a fine harbor. For this work a force of carpenters was sent from New York.
      The timber of which they were to construct the vessels was growing in the
      woods, and the trees had to be felled and worked up at once; there was no
      time to wait for the wood to season. All the ironwork, canvas, cordage,
      and stores had to be brought from New York or Philadelphia, and as there
      was neither railroad nor canal, and much of the intervening country was a
      wilderness, the difficulties of transportation were very great. A bar at
      the mouth of the harbor, on which there was but seven feet of water,
      prevented the British cruisers from sailing in and destroying the vessels
      before they were launched.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Oliver Hazard Perry, who, though quite young, had seen
      considerable service afloat, was ordered from the seaboard to take command
      on Lake Erie, and arrived at Buffalo in March. His volunteer service in
      the attack on Fort George has been already mentioned. The fall of that
      work was followed by the abandonment of Fort Erie, which released the
      vessels that had been blockaded by its guns in the upper part of the
      Niagara, and early in June they rendezvoused at Presque Isle. <span
      class="pagenum">128</span><a name="link128" id="link128"></a>Perry now had
      his entire force in one harbor, and pushed on his equipment with the
      greatest possible speed. One of the new brigs was made his flagship, and
      was named the <i>Lawrence</i>. The bar that had thus far protected the
      fleet was now a hindrance to its sailing, for it could be passed by the
      larger vessels only in calm weather, and even then they must be lightened
      of their guns and heavy stores. The British commander, Captain R. H.
      Barclay, was watching with his entire fleet for Perry to come out. If, as
      is supposed, he intended to attack him while crossing the bar, when he
      could probably have won a victory, he lost his opportunity by attending to
      pleasure before duty. A gentleman living on the northern shore of the lake
      invited him to dinner one Sunday, and he crossed over with his whole
      squadron. At the same time the water became smooth, and Perry, who had
      been eagerly watching for such a chance, proceeded to take out his fleet
      at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Lawrence</i>, which was his heaviest vessel, was provided with a
      large scow on each side, and on her arrival at the bar these scows were
      nearly filled with water, and sunk very low. Great beams were then passed
      through her port-holes, the ends projecting over the scows. Piles of
      blocks were provided for these ends to rest upon, and then the holes in
      the scows were plugged up, and the water pumped out. <span class="pagenum">129</span><a
      name="link129" id="link129"></a>As the scows rose, they lifted the brig
      with them. But though her guns had been taken out and left on the beach,
      as well as all other heavy articles that could be removed, she still drew
      too much water to pass the bar. Another lift was made, which occupied the
      night, and finally she floated across. The other brig, the <i>Niagara</i>,
      was not quite so large, and was taken over with less difficulty. The
      lighter vessels had crossed the bar without assistance; and on the
      approach of the English squadron at eight o'clock the next morning, it was
      received with a cannonade, which, though it did no harm, prevented Barclay
      from running in close and seizing the prey he had been so long watching
      for. The <i>Lawrence's</i> guns were taken on board as soon as she was
      afloat outside, and the broadside was trained to bear on the enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was Monday, the 5th of August, and Perry was now afloat on Lake Erie
      with ten vessels, carrying fifty-five guns and&mdash;after he had received
      several reënforcements&mdash;about four hundred men. Captain Barclay had
      about the same number of men, in six vessels, carrying sixty-five guns,
      his flagship being the <i>Detroit</i>. As soon as the American fleet was
      fairly over the bar, the British sailed away up the lake, and it took
      Perry a month to find them and bring them to action. He was at Put-in-Bay;
      in <span class="pagenum">130</span><a name="link130" id="link130"></a>one
      of the islands near the western end of the lake, when at sunrise on the
      morning of September 10th the British fleet was sighted from the masthead,
      bearing down from the northwest, apparently bent on having a fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perry had given the commanders of his several vessels careful instructions
      what to do in case of an engagement, ending with the remark that "they
      could not be out of their proper places if they laid their enemy close
      alongside." Within an hour after the enemy was sighted, the squadron was
      beating out of the bay. The wind was from the southwest, which made it
      impossible for the Americans to get the weather-gage, unless by
      circumnavigating some of the islands. As there was apparently no time for
      this, Perry determined to accept the chances of battle without that
      advantage, and accordingly passed to leeward of the islands. But fortune
      favored him unexpectedly, for the wind soon shifted to the southeast,
      giving him the weather-gage, which for vessels armed as his were was very
      important.
    </p>
    <p>
      At ten o'clock the British squadron, having failed in manoeuvres for the
      weather-gage, hove to, in line of battle, with their bows to the west and
      south, and awaited the approach of their enemy, now about nine miles
      distant. One of the smaller vessels was at the head of the line, and the
      <i>Detroit</i>, Barclay's <span class="pagenum">131</span><a name="link131"
      id="link131"></a>flagship, next; then came another small vessel, and then
      the <i>Queen Charlotte</i>, a large one, and then the two remaining small
      ones. The British vessels were all freshly painted, and had new canvas,
      presenting a handsome appearance to the eye of a sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Perry approached and observed this order, he formed his own line to
      correspond with it. He placed two schooners in the van, one carrying four
      guns and the other two; then his flagship, the <i>Lawrence</i>; then the
      <i>Caledonia</i>, of three guns; then the <i>Niagara</i>, of twenty; and
      then the other vessels, which, however, as the wind was light, did not
      come up very promptly. The orders were, that the vessels should be but
      half a cable's length apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he approached the enemy. Perry displayed a blue flag bearing the words,
      "Don't give up the ship." * A few minutes before twelve o'clock, a bugle
      was sounded on the British flagship, which was answered by cheers from all
      the other vessels in the line, and followed by the discharge of one of her
      long guns, pointed at the Lawrence. As the American was still a mile and a
      half distant, the shot fell short; but this space was being gradually
      lessened, and the battle was soon fairly opened. One of the two schooners
      in the van replied with a
    </p>
    <p>
      * For the origin of this motto, see page 199.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">132</span><a name="link132" id="link132"></a>long
      gun, while the <i>Lawrence</i>, being armed with carronades, bore down
      upon the British flagship, to engage her at short range. This she
      succeeded in doing, but not without suffering considerably, and the three
      largest of the British vessels concentrated their fire on her. The two
      foremost schooners fought their long guns well; but as they had been
      ordered to keep to windward of the flagship (that is, a little farther
      from the enemy) they did not draw off any of the fire from her. But, after
      two hours of this, the <i>Niagara</i> drew ahead of the <i>Caledonia</i>,
      thus assuming the place in the line next to the <i>Lawrence</i>, and
      fought most gallantly; still, this hardly lessened the fire that was
      poured into the flagship, which the enemy seemed determined to sink. Many
      of her spars were shot away, all of her guns on the starboard side, but
      one, were rendered useless, and of a hundred men on board, twenty-two were
      killed and sixty-one wounded&mdash;a proportion of casualties that had
      never been equalled in any similar battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Lawrence</i> dropped out of the fight, and Perry transferred his
      flag to the <i>Niagara</i>, which pulled ahead to a position for engaging
      the <i>Detroit</i>. When the enemy saw the flag come down, they supposed
      they had gained a victory, stopped firing, and cheered. But the decisive
      struggle was yet to come. Captain Elliott, of the <i>Niagara</i>, passed
      down <span class="pagenum">133</span><a name="link133" id="link133"></a>the
      line in a small boat, delivering to the commander of each vessel Perry's
      order to close up and attack the enemy at half pistol-shot with grape and
      canister. He then remained with and commanded one of the last vessels in
      the line, leaving the <i>Niagara</i> to Perry.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time the wind freshened, Perry showed the signal for close action,
      an answering cheer passed along his line, and once more the whole squadron
      bore down upon the enemy. Barclay attempted to manoeuvre his vessels so as
      to bring his uninjured broadsides to bear; but his line got into
      confusion, and two of the vessels fouled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perry took prompt advantage of this. The <i>Niagara</i> sailed right
      through the confused British line, having two of their vessels on one
      side, and three on the other&mdash;all within short range&mdash;and
      delivered her deadly broadsides in both directions as she passed. Then she
      luffed across their bows, and raked them, and the cries that came from the
      <i>Detroit</i> told that this merciless operation had had its usual deadly
      effect. At the same time, the other American vessels came into close
      action, and their guns were served with great rapidity. This destructive
      work had lasted about twenty minutes when an officer of the <i>Queen
      Charlotte</i> displayed a white handkerchief on the point of a pike, and
      four of the <span class="pagenum">134</span><a name="link134" id="link134"></a>British
      vessels struck their colors. The other two attempted to escape, but were
      overtaken in about an hour and compelled to surrender.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this battle, the entire loss of the Americans was twenty-seven killed
      and ninety-six wounded. Twelve of these were quarterdeck officers. As more
      than a hundred out of four hundred on board had previously been rendered
      unfit for duty by dysentery and cholera, the proportion of casualties to
      effective men was more than one in three. The British lost forty-one
      killed and ninety-four wounded, including twelve officers. Captain
      Barclay, who had lost his left arm in a previous engagement, in this one
      lost the use of his right.
    </p>
    <p>
      The masts of the <i>Detroit</i> and <i>Queen Charlotte</i> were so injured
      that they snapped off two days later, from the rolling of the vessels in
      the bay, while riding at anchor during a gale.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a despatch to General Harrison, Perry announced his victory in words
      that have become famous: "We have met the enemy, and they are ours: two
      ships, two brigs, one schooner, and one sloop." Congress voted him a gold
      medal for his achievement. As the question of the fighting qualities of
      the black man has since been considerably discussed, it is worth noting
      that in this bloody and brilliant battle a large number of Perry's men
      were <span class="pagenum">135</span><a name="link135" id="link135"></a>Negroes.
      Much of the credit of the victory has been claimed for Captain Jesse D.
      Elliott, who undoubtedly deserved it, and his services were generously
      acknowledged in Perry's official report.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many interesting incidents of this famous action have been related by
      different participants. At the opening of the battle, the English
      musicians played the well-known air of "Rule, Britannia!&mdash;Britannia,
      rule the waves!"&mdash;on which the result of the fight was a ludicrous
      comment, proving that an exception must be made in favor of the waves of
      Lake Erie.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the British flagship there was a pet bear, and when the victors stepped
      on board they found it eagerly lapping up the blood from the deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      The British commander had repeated the silly performance of nailing his
      colors to the mast, which never has any other effect than to sacrifice
      lives that might have been saved if the signal of surrender, when
      surrender became necessary, could have been displayed instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Captain Barclay's vessel were three Indians, whom he placed in the
      tops, or cross-trees, with rifles in their hands, to pick off the American
      officers, that kind of work being exactly suited to their taste. But as
      the first part of the action was fought at long cannon-range, beyond the
      reach of rifle-shot, they found themselves in danger from numerous <span
      class="pagenum">136</span><a name="link136" id="link136"></a>large balls
      that went tearing through the rigging, and at the same time totally unable
      to murder anybody on the distant vessels. Indians have always stood in
      mortal terror of artillery. So they descended to the deck; but here they
      found it still more dangerous, and finally the disgusted braves retreated
      down the hatchway. When the Americans came on board, they found them
      hidden in the hold. This is probably the only instance of Indians taking
      part, or attempting to take part, in modern naval warfare. But they have a
      legend of a great Indian naval battle that took place on the waters of
      this same lake two hundred years before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Senecas&mdash;so runs the story&mdash;who inhabited the southern and
      eastern shores of Ontario and the St. Lawrence, had declared war against
      the Wyandots, who inhabited the northern and western shores. A Wyandot
      chief, gambling with a Seneca, had won his wife; but the Seneca refused to
      give her up. Shortly afterward she eloped with the Wyandot, and they
      escaped to the country of the Pottawatomies, in Michigan. This was the
      cause of the war, which the Senecas began by crossing the St. Lawrence,
      surprising a Wyandot village, and cruelly murdering a large number of the
      inhabitants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally the whole Wyandot nation fled before their enemies, passed along
      the northern shore of Lake <span class="pagenum">137</span><a
      name="link137" id="link137"></a>Ontario, crossed the peninsula north of
      Lake Erie, and after great suffering and serious losses escaped by
      crossing St. Clair River on cakes of floating ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next summer the Senecas planned a naval expedition against the
      Wyandots, to be fitted out at the eastern end of Lake Erie, near the
      present site of Buffalo, pass up the lake and through Detroit River, and
      rescue the stolen squaw and exterminate the tribe. But the Wyandots had
      early information of this design, and several of the tribes inhabiting the
      peninsula of Michigan joined with them in preparations to repel the
      threatened invasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The war-canoes built by the Senecas were "dug-outs," hewn from the trunks
      of large trees. The Wyandots and their allies prepared a fleet of
      birch-bark canoes, which were much lighter, swifter, and more easily
      manoeuvred, and went down the lake to meet their enemy. They coasted along
      the northern shore as far as North Point, where they waited to make a
      reconnoissance. The Wyandot who had carried off the woman crossed the lake
      alone, climbed a tall tree overlooking the rendezvous of the Senecas, and
      counted their craft and noted their preparations. Then he passed by a wide
      circuit around their encampment, swam the Niagara below the Falls, and the
      next day rejoined the fleet of the allies, to whom he was able to give all
      necessary in<span class="pagenum">138</span><a name="link138" id="link138"></a>formation
      as to the number and equipment of their enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      They set sail&mdash;or rather pulled paddles&mdash;at once. But when in
      full sight of the Senecas, pretended to be frightened, and retreated. The
      Senecas gave a war whoop, launched their heavy canoes, and pad-died after
      them as fast as possible. When the allies had thus drawn their antagonists
      far away from the shore, they suddenly turned upon them, and a bloody and
      merciless battle ensued, which lasted for several hours. Indian after
      Indian was cut down, or gradually hacked to pieces, or knocked overboard.
      Some of the canoes were run down; others were grappled together while
      their occupants fought hand-to-hand. The lighter boats of the allies were
      a great advantage, and finally the Senecas were defeated. The dead and the
      badly wounded were then thrown overboard, while the prisoners were
      reserved for torture. One Seneca was found to have concealed himself in
      the bottom of a canoe, feigning death that he might escape captivity. The
      victors cut off his nose and ears, and knocked out his teeth, and in that
      disgraceful plight sent him home to bear the news of the disaster to his
      tribe. On the bank of Niagara River the captured canoes were piled up for
      a funeral pyre, and a hundred of the wounded Senecas were tied and laid
      upon it, Fire was set to it. <span class="pagenum">139</span><a
      name="link139" id="link139"></a>and as one and another escaped when his
      shackles were burned off, he was shot down with arrows or brained with a
      war-club. When the victims were all reduced to ashes, the allies
      celebrated their victory with a feast and dance, and then returned home.
      Such was the legend told by Walk-in-the-Water, a Wyandot chief, when he
      heard of Perry's victory, which he thought was a small affair in
      comparison with the exploit of his ancestors.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the capture of the British fleet, the lakes were cleared of the enemy,
      and but one more movement was necessary in order to restore to the United
      States all that had been lost by Hull's surrender. How successfully that
      movement was executed will be shown in the next chapter.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he opportunity
      which General Harrison had been waiting for had now arrived. He had been
      joined by Governor Shelby, of Kentucky, who brought three thousand five
      hundred mounted men, and also by two hundred Indians. His preparations for
      an invasion of Canada were complete; and Perry's victory not only gave him
      the necessary means of transportation, but removed a hostile fleet that
      might have prevented his landing an army on Canadian soil. His troops
      rendezvoused on the peninsula near Sandusky; the total force, including a
      few regulars, numbering about five thousand men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Richard M. Johnson, with his regiment of cavalry, was sent to
      Detroit by land, there to cross the river. All the other troops, with
      their equipments, were taken on board Perry's vessels and carried up
      Detroit River, and landed, on the 27th of September, at a point three
      miles below Amherstburg.
    </p>
    <p>
      They marched at once on Malden, and took <span class="pagenum">141</span><a
      name="link141" id="link141"></a>possession of that post without
      opposition. The British General Proctor had abandoned it, but not till he
      had destroyed the barracks, the stores, and as much of the fortifications
      as was possible. Harrison expected a fight, and had his forces formed in
      battle order as they advanced; but Proctor's purpose was simply to get out
      of the way of his enemy, and escape if possible to Niagara. He had about
      six hundred white soldiers who were fit for duty, and a force of Indians
      variously estimated at from eight hundred to fifteen hundred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harrison left detachments at Detroit, Amherstburg, and Sandwich, and with
      the remainder of his force&mdash;about three thousand five hundred men&mdash;set
      out, on the 2d of October, in pursuit of Proctor. The enemy had retreated
      along the southern shore of Lake St. Clair, and thence up the river
      Thames, which flows into that lake. Proctor's baggage and artillery were
      carried by water, in small vessels; and Harrison in his pursuit was
      materially aided by Captain Perry, whose boats carried the baggage and
      supplies the whole length of the lake and fifteen miles up the river. At
      that point Perry left the water, and served on Harrison's staff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four considerable streams crossed the line of retreat, and Proctor might
      have seriously delayed the pursuit, and perhaps entirely stopped it, by
      destroy<span class="pagenum">142</span><a name="link142" id="link142"></a>ing
      the bridge over any one of them. He seems not to have thought of this at
      the first stream, where the Americans found the bridge intact. At the
      second, a lieutenant and eleven men had been left with orders to destroy
      the bridge; but before they had accomplished their task, Harrison's
      advance guard came up and captured them. The third bridge, partially
      destroyed, was defended by a considerable body of Indians; but a few shots
      from two six-pounders dispersed them, and the structure was soon repaired.
      The fourth bridge was likewise partly destroyed, and guarded by Indians,
      who were not so easily driven away. The mounted Kentuckians pushed
      forward, and had a brisk skirmish with the savages, in which half a dozen
      of the whites were killed or wounded, and thirteen of the Indians were
      killed. The enemy then set fire to a large house, near the bridge, a
      distillery, and three vessels that were loaded with military stores, and
      continued his retreat. As soon as the bridge could be repaired, Harrison's
      troops crossed it, extinguished the fire in the house, and found in it two
      thousand stand of arms. Early on the 5th the pursuit was renewed. The
      route was still along the Thames, and in the course of the day the
      Americans captured two gunboats and several batteaux, all laden with
      provisions and ammunition. <span class="pagenum">143</span><a
      name="link143" id="link143"></a>By this time, Proctor's Indians were tired
      of retreating, and were determined either to have a fight of some sort or
      leave him. About sixty of them actually deserted, and offered their
      services to Harrison, who declined them&mdash;not because he disbelieved
      in the employment of Indians, for he had some in his own force, but
      probably because he thought it unwise to employ troops of any sort who
      recognized no principle and were ready to go from one side to the other as
      the fortunes of war might fluctuate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both armies were now on the north side of the Thames, and Harrison's
      scouts brought news that the enemy had formed in line of battle at a point
      about two and a half miles from Moravian Town, four miles in advance of
      where Harrison then was. At the place chosen there was a marsh, the edge
      of which was about five hundred yards distant from the river and parallel
      with it for two miles. Midway between was a little marsh. The road ran
      between the little marsh and the river. The ground was largely covered
      with an open growth of forest trees, but there was no underbrush.
    </p>
    <p>
      Proctor placed his best English troops, with his artillery, in a line
      stretching from the river to the little marsh, his cannon commanding the
      road. Behind this line were his reserves. The Indians, com<span
      class="pagenum">144</span><a name="link144" id="link144"></a>manded by
      Tecumseh, who was a brigadier-general in the British service, formed a
      line between the two marshes, and a large number of them were thrown
      forward in the edge of the great marsh, that they might fall upon the left
      flank of the Americans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harrison placed his mounted troops in front, and behind them two thirds of
      his infantry, while the remainder was thrown back at an angle on the left,
      to be able to face the Indians in the marsh. The mounted men were formed
      in two columns, all under command of Colonel Richard M. Johnson, who rode
      with the left column. The right column was commanded immediately by his
      brother, Lieutenant-Colonel James Johnson.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sound of the bugle, the columns rode forward, slowly and steadily
      at first. As the right column came within musket-shot of the enemy, it
      received a volley or two, and here and there a trooper tumbled from his
      horse. The pace was immediately quickened, and in two minutes a solid
      column of a thousand dragoons went crashing through the British line,
      cutting down every opposing soldier within reach of its sabres. The column
      immediately re-formed in rear of the enemy's position, and repeated the
      charge, at the same time firing into the broken ranks, when the entire
      left wing was thrown into confusion before the men could fix <span
      class="pagenum">145</span><a name="link145" id="link145"></a>their
      bayonets, and four hundred and seventy of them, with their officers,
      surrendered.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other wing, as Colonel Richard M. Johnson's column rode up at a
      charge, the Indians reserved their fire till they were within a few paces,
      and then gave them a destructive volley. Almost the whole of the advance
      guard fell before it, and Colonel Johnson was wounded. Finding that the
      ground here, between the two marshes, was unsuitable for horses, Colonel
      Johnson at once ordered his men to dismount, and for eight or ten minutes
      there was hard fighting, at close range, with the rifle. After charges and
      counter-charges, the Indians began to give way. At this moment Governor
      Shelby brought up the reserves, and about the same time Tecumseh fell, and
      the savages then broke and fled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question, who killed Tecumseh, though not of much importance, has been
      warmly discussed. Thomson, one of the earliest authorities for the history
      of this war, says: "Colonel R. M. Johnson had been five times wounded, and
      in that state, covered with blood, and exhausted by pain and fatigue, he
      personally encountered Tecumseh. The Colonel was mounted on a white
      charger, at which, being a conspicuous object, the Indians had continually
      levelled their fire. A shower of bullets had fallen round him; his
      holsters, his clothes, and most of his <span class="pagenum">146</span><a
      name="link146" id="link146"></a>accoutrements were pierced in several
      places; and at the instant when he discovered Tecumseh, his horse received
      a second wound. Tecumseh, having discharged his rifle, sprang forward with
      his tomahawk, and had it already raised to throw, when Colonel Johnson's
      horse staggered back, and immediately the Colonel drew forth a pistol,
      shot the Indian through the head, and both fell to the ground together."
    </p>
    <p>
      When the savages in front were defeated, those that had been posted in the
      edge of the great marsh vanished through the woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Proctor, when he saw his lines broken, abandoned the field and
      drove off with all possible speed in his carriage, accompanied by a
      mounted body guard. He was conscious that he deserved no quarter for his
      cold-blooded massacres, and feared that if he fell into the hands of
      American soldiers he might get his deserts. As a matter of fact, General
      Harrison had instructed his men before the battle that if Proctor was
      captured he should be brought in unharmed. A detachment sent in pursuit of
      him pressed him so closely that he abandoned his carriage, leaving his
      sword and private papers in it, and took to the woods; where, as he was
      well mounted and familiar with the country, they could not overtake him.
      But though he escaped the <span class="pagenum">147</span><a name="link147"
      id="link147"></a>Americans, by his own government he was court-martialled,
      reprimanded, and suspended for six months. If he had previously been
      punished for violating the laws of war, and an abler and better man put
      into his place, this disaster might not have befallen the British arms. It
      was not when they massacred defenceless people, but only when they lost
      battles, that the English Government was dissatisfied with unsoldier-like
      conduct in its officers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this action, the Americans lost about fifty men killed or wounded.
      Among the killed was Colonel Whitley, a soldier of the Revolution, who had
      volunteered as a private. The British lost about a hundred and eighty
      killed or wounded, and nearly all the remainder were made prisoners. It
      was supposed that about a hundred and twenty Indians were killed; at least
      thirty-three were left dead on the field, and an unknown number carried
      away. Among the spoils of the victory were several brass cannon which had
      been captured with Burgoyne at Saratoga, surrendered by Hull at Detroit,
      and now came a second time into the hands of the Americans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harrison destroyed Moravian Town the day after the battle, and then
      marched back to Detroit. Proctor had the good taste to send a flag of
      truce, requesting that the prisoners be humanely treated. As General
      Harrison had already given up his own <span class="pagenum">148</span><a
      name="link148" id="link148"></a>tent to some of the wounded British
      officers, it is probable that they were.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this brief and brilliant campaign, Harrison destroyed the British power
      in that part of Canada, restored the territory of Michigan to the United
      States, killed the great Indian leader who had been the most dangerous
      enemy of the Americans in the West, separated the tribes that had been
      assisting the English, and compelled some of them to make peace on his own
      terms. At Detroit he discharged Shelby's volunteers, gave the place a
      garrison of a thousand men, restored civil law, and made General Cass
      provisional governor of the territory. Three weeks later, he and the
      remainder of his troops were taken on board Perry's fleet and carried to
      Buffalo.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the same day that the battle of the Thames was fought, Commodore
      Chauncey, in pursuit of Yeo's fleet on Lake Ontario, captured a cutter and
      four transports, on board of which were two hundred and sixty-four British
      officers and soldiers.

    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he final military
      operations of this year on the northern border were the most
      disappointing, and on the whole the most disgraceful, of any that had been
      undertaken. General John Armstrong had become Secretary of War early in
      the year, and in February had submitted a plan, which the President at
      once approved, for the conquest of Canada by means of an expedition
      against Montreal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Armstrong had seen service in the Revolution, and was the author of the
      anonymous "Newburg Addresses," which had given Washington so much trouble.
      Although he planned the expedition in February, he allowed the entire
      summer to go by before attempting its execution, and it set out in
      October, the worst time of year for such an undertaking. The first
      requisite for any military movement is, that it shall be under the supreme
      command of some one man. But the left wing of the army <span
      class="pagenum">150</span><a name="link150" id="link150"></a>which was to
      make this one was commanded by General James Wilkinson, at Sackett's
      Harbor, while the right wing was under General Wade Hampton, at
      Plattsburg, and between these two officers there was not only no cordial
      friendship, but a positive jealousy that rendered it almost impossible for
      them to act in concert. Although Wilkinson was the ranking officer,
      Hampton maintained that his own must be considered as a separate and
      independent command, and himself not subordinate to anybody but the
      Secretary of War. He thus put in practice on a small scale a vicious
      principle whose advocacy on a vastly larger scale has since given some of
      his descendants an unenviable prominence.
    </p>
    <p>
      So old a soldier as Armstrong should have known that the first thing
      necessary to the success of his scheme was the removal of one or the other
      of these officers, and conferring upon some one general the absolute
      command of all forces that were to take part in it. As he had stationed
      himself and his War Department at Sackett's Harbor, he perhaps imagined
      that he could direct the expedition from there, and, holding both generals
      subordinate to himself, cause the two wings to act in concert. If so, he
      was wofully mistaken. A man sixty years of age, who owned three thousand
      slaves and was accustomed to no check upon his least caprice, who <span
      class="pagenum">151</span><a name="link151" id="link151"></a>now had four
      thousand troops under his command &mdash;a large number in that war&mdash;and
      was distant a hundred and fifty miles from his superior, with a wilderness
      between, could not be expected to hold himself subordinate to anybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Wilkinson had removed most of the troops from Fort George on the
      Niagara, taking them down the lake, and he now had a total force of about
      eight thousand men. The right wing, under Hampton, numbered half as many
      more. The final plan was, to move down the St. Lawrence with Wilkinson's
      force, while Hampton's moved northward to unite with it at or near the
      mouth of the Chateaugua; the combined force then to strike for Montreal.
      Wilkinson rendezvoused his troops at Grenadier Island, eighteen miles
      below Sackett's Harbor, near the point where the waters of the lake find
      their outlet in the St. Lawrence. The British were apprised of the
      movement, and drew a large force from the Niagara frontier to Kingston,
      supposing that was to be the point of attack; and indeed this had been the
      first intention of the Americans. To strengthen this impression on the
      part of the enemy, and induce him to hold his forces at Kingston as long
      as possible, Wilkinson appointed a second rendezvous at the mouth of
      French Creek, eighteen miles farther down. The command of the <span
      class="pagenum">152</span><a name="link152" id="link152"></a>advance was
      given to General Jacob Brown, who had successfully defended Sackett's
      Harbor in May. On the 1st and 2d of November the British squadron attacked
      the advance, but without effecting anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 5th Wilkinson's entire force moved down the St. Lawrence. They
      occupied more than three hundred boats, which made a procession five miles
      long. At Prescott the river was commanded by British batteries, and to
      avoid them Wilkinson debarked his troops and stores a short distance above
      that place, and sent them by land to Red Mill, some distance below. The
      boats were run by the batteries at night, and escaped injury, though under
      a heavy fire for a considerable time.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was found that the enemy had planted batteries at several other
      places, to obstruct and if possible destroy the flotilla. Colonel
      Alexander Macomb was ordered to cross the river with twelve hundred of the
      best troops in the army, and, marching down the north bank, abreast of the
      flotilla, drive away or capture the gunners. In this task he was assisted
      by Forsyth's riflemen, who crossed a little later. The cavalry and Brown's
      brigade passed over next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      They found plenty of fighting to do, though of a desultory kind. There was
      a battery at nearly <span class="pagenum">153</span><a name="link153"
      id="link153"></a>every narrow place in the river, and small parties of the
      enemy were continually hanging on the rear of the Americans, firing
      whenever they found a chance. Eight miles below Hamilton, Macomb had a
      fight with a party strongly posted in a block-house, and succeeded in
      driving them out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile General De Rottenburg, who had come down to Kingston from
      Queenstown, sent a force of fifteen hundred men, with two schooners and
      seven gunboats, to follow the expedition and attack its rear guard at
      every opportunity. It was Commodore Chauncey's duty to prevent any British
      force from leaving the harbor of Kingston at this time; but unaccountably
      he failed to do it. On the 9th the American riflemen had a brisk skirmish
      with a body of Canadian militia and Indians, and finally drove them off.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the 10th the Long Rapid was reached, and Wilkinson put most of his men
      ashore, that the boats might shoot the rapid with greater safety. That
      evening the British gun-boats came up and opened a cannonade upon the
      barges, which for a time threatened to destroy them. But the Americans
      took two eighteen-pounders ashore, and improvised a battery, with which
      they soon drove off the gun-boats.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the enemy's forces were pretty well <span class="pagenum">154</span><a
      name="link154" id="link154"></a>united in the rear of the expedition, and
      the gunboats had been brought to act in concert. It was evident that the
      Americans could not safely proceed farther till a battle had been fought.
    </p>
    <p>
      The troops were encamped on the farm of John Chrysler, a captain in the
      British service, a short distance below Williamsburg. On the morning of
      the 11th it was found that the enemy had taken a position close in the
      rear, in battle order, his left resting on a swamp, and his right on the
      river, where his gun-boats were moored. His line was well placed, and he
      had three pieces of artillery in position. As General Wilkinson was too
      ill to take the field, or even rise from his bed, the command of the
      American forces devolved upon General John Parker Boyd. Boyd, now about
      fifty years of age, had entered the United States service as early as
      1786, but later had been a soldier of fortune in India, raising and
      equipping there, at his own expense, a force of fifteen hundred men, and
      selling their services to the highest bidder. Still later he returned to
      the United States, and was with Harrison at the battle of Tippecanoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orders were given to drive back the enemy, and General Robert Swartwout's
      brigade dashed into the woods and routed the British advance, which fell
      back upon the main body. The brigade of General <span class="pagenum">155</span><a
      name="link155" id="link155"></a>Leonard Covington supported Swartwout's,
      attacking the British right while Swartwout attacked the left. It was a
      cold, raw day, and part of the time there was snow and sleet in the air.
      There were charges and counter-charges, the contending columns alternately
      advancing and retiring across ploughed fields, where the men were often up
      to their knees in mud. All the romance of war was lacking, while all its
      disagreeable elements were present in full force. There were wounds
      enough, and death enough, and misery enough, and, as it proved, no
      decisive or profitable victory for either side. The Americans had the
      greater number of men, but this advantage was fully counterbalanced by the
      fact that they were, the attacking party, and there were several deep
      ravines which they could not cross with their artillery to bring it into
      use, while the British used their own guns throughout the action.
    </p>
    <p>
      The attack was spirited and determined, and seemed likely to succeed; but
      after a while the American right wing found its ammunition exhausted, and
      about the same time the left was discouraged and thrown into some
      confusion by the fall of General Covington, mortally wounded. The enemy
      now massed troops on his right wing, and pressed forward heavily, so that
      he captured one of the American guns; a charge of cavalry under Adjutant<span
      class="pagenum">156</span><a name="link156" id="link156"></a>General
      Walbach, and the coolness and bravery of Captain Armstrong Irvine, being
      all that prevented him from seizing the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      For two hours longer the contest swayed to and fro across the miry fields
      for the distance of a mile, till the Americans brought up a reserve of six
      hundred men under Lieutenant-Colonel Upham, by which order was restored
      and the line firmly established, to await the next onset of the enemy. But
      no further assault was made, and in the night the Americans retired
      unmolested to their boats.
    </p>
    <p>
      This action is sometimes called the battle of Williamsburg, sometimes the
      battle of Chrysler's Field. Both sides claimed the victory, and there has
      been much dispute both as to the number of men engaged and as to the
      losses. The British probably had a thousand men, including Indians; the
      Americans seventeen hundred. General Wilkinson reported a loss of one
      hundred and two killed, and two hundred and thirty-seven wounded&mdash;one
      man in five. The British loss was reported at one hundred and eighty-eight
      killed, wounded, or missing&mdash;nearly one in five. Among the American
      officers who distinguished themselves on this field was Lieutenant William
      J. Worth, who afterward rose to eminence as a major-general.
    </p>
    <p>
      Disregarding the military maxim which forbids an <span class="pagenum">157</span><a
      name="link157" id="link157"></a>invading army to leave an enemy in its
      rear, Wilkinson next day passed down the Long Rapids with his whole force,
      and near Cornwall was joined by General Brown, who had been sent forward
      to attack the post at the foot of the rapids. This had been done by a
      fight at Hoophole Creek, where about eight hundred of Brown's men, under
      the immediate command of Colonel Scott, had defeated an equal number of
      the enemy and taken many prisoners.
    </p>
    <p>
      But here a courier arrived at Wilkinson's headquarters, bringing a letter
      from General Hampton, in which he announced that he would not join the
      expedition as ordered, or attempt to invade Canada any farther.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth was, Hampton had moved down the Chateaugua with about four
      thousand men, intending to join Wilkinson. He was opposed by a force of
      about one thousand, including Indians, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel De
      Salaberry. The active opposition began at a point where the road passed
      through a forest. Here the enemy had felled trees across the line of
      march, constructed abattis, and posted light troops and Indians in the
      woods. But Hampton sent a regiment to turn the enemy's flank and occupy
      the open country in the rear, while strong working parties opened a new
      road by a de<span class="pagenum">158</span><a name="link158" id="link158"></a>tour,
      enabling his whole force to follow, and thus the first obstruction was
      skilfully passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But eight or ten miles in advance a more formidable obstacle was
      encountered. Here was another forest, in which the enemy had constructed
      not only abattis but timber breastworks, and planted artillery. The guides
      assured Hampton that the river, along whose bank his route lay, was
      fordable opposite the enemy's flank. He thereupon formed an elaborate plan
      for sending a force to ford the stream above, march to a point below the
      enemy, ford again, and fall on his flank and rear; while the main body was
      to attack in front when the firing was heard. The detachment was commanded
      by Colonel Purdy, who afterward said it "was intrusted to the guidance of
      men, each of whom repeatedly assured him [Hampton] that they were not
      acquainted with the country, and were not competent to direct such an
      expedition; while at the same time he had a man who had a perfect
      knowledge of the country, whom he promised to send, but which he neglected
      to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      The detachment, which left camp in the evening of October 25th, crossed
      the stream, and soon got lost in a hemlock swamp, where it wandered about
      in the darkness, sometimes doubling on its tracks, so that the two ends of
      the column would come in con<span class="pagenum">159</span><a
      name="link159" id="link159"></a>tact with each other and wonder whether
      they had met friend or foe. As might have been expected, it completely
      failed to find the lower ford.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoon of the 26th, though nothing had been heard from the
      detachment, the main force moved against the works in front. De Salaberry
      boldly threw forward a force to meet it, resting his left on the river and
      his right on a thick wood, in the edge of which he posted a body of
      Indians. The cracking of rifles began at once, and sharp and persistent
      fighting ensued. Slowly and steadily the Americans, under the immediate
      command of General George Izard, pressed back this advance upon the main
      body of the enemy. But at this point the detachment across the river
      encountered a detachment of British troops. Purdy's advance guard was
      driven back, and then fire was opened upon him by a concealed body of
      militia, which threw him into confusion and caused a disorderly retreat.
      At the same time, Hampton was deceived by a ruse of De Salaberry's, who
      had placed buglers at several points in the woods, with orders to sound an
      advance. Thoroughly disconcerted, and perhaps frightened by this failure
      of his plan, and the supposed onset of a great force of the enemy, Hampton
      at once withdrew his troops and abandoned the attack, falling back soon
      afterward to Chateaugua Four Corners. <span class="pagenum">160</span><a
      name="link160" id="link160"></a>He had lost about forty men killed or
      wounded; the enemy about twenty-five.
    </p>
    <p>
      On learning of the defection of Hampton, Wilkinson called a council of
      war, the result of which was a determination to ascend Salmon River and go
      into winter quarters. Thus ended ingloriously one more of the ill-advised
      and ill-managed attempts to conquer Lower Canada.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cost of these campaigns had been enormous to both belligerents. The
      Americans had spent about two and a half million dollars in building
      vessels on lakes Erie, Ontario, and Champlain; which was a large sum for
      that day, and yet was small in comparison with the incidental cost of
      maintaining considerable bodies of troops in idleness through a whole
      summer while waiting for the fleets to be built. It was estimated that the
      conveyance of each cannon to Sackett's Harbor had cost a thousand dollars.
      The flour for Harrison's army, by the time it reached the troops, had cost
      a hundred dollars a barrel. There were long distances through the
      wilderness of Western New York and Northern Ohio where supplies could only
      be carried on packhorses, half a barrel to a horse, and other horses had
      to follow with forage for those that were carrying the supplies. Most of
      the horses were used up by a single trip. Of four thousand used in
      carrying provisions <span class="pagenum">161</span><a name="link161"
      id="link161"></a>to Harrison, but eight hundred were alive the next
      spring. In Canada the hardships of war rested heavily upon the people as
      well as the soldiers. All their salt had come from the United States, and
      what little there was on that side of the border when communication with
      this country ceased was held at a dollar a quart. At Kingston flour was
      thirty dollars a barrel. So scarce were provisions of all kinds, that the
      Government appointed commissioners to determine how much food each family
      should be permitted to consume. In the British camps, lean cattle were
      killed to prevent their starving to death, and then the meat was eaten by
      the soldiers. In later wars we have often succeeded in shooting more men,
      but seldom in producing more misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The withdrawal of troops from the Niagara frontier to take part in
      Wilkinson's expedition left the defence of that line almost entirely to
      militia, and the term for which the militia had been called out expired on
      the 9th of December. The next day General George McClure, who had been
      left in command at Fort George, found himself at the head of but sixty
      effective men, while the British General Drummond had brought up to the
      peninsula four hundred troops and seventy Indians&mdash;released by the
      failure of Wilkinson's expedition&mdash;and was preparing to attack him.
      <span class="pagenum">162</span><a name="link162" id="link162"></a>McClure
      thereupon determined to evacuate the fort, as the only alternative from
      capture or destruction, and remove his men and stores across the river to
      Fort Niagara. He also determined to burn the village of Newark, that the
      enemy might find no shelter. The laudable part of this plan was but
      imperfectly carried out; he failed to destroy the barracks, and left
      unharmed tents for fifteen hundred men, several pieces of artillery, and a
      large quantity of ammunition, all of which fell into the hands of
      Drummond's men. But the inexcusable part&mdash;the burning of a village in
      midwinter, inhabited by noncombatants who had been guilty of no special
      offence&mdash;was only too faithfully executed. The inhabitants were given
      twelve hours in which to remove their goods, and then the torch was
      applied, and not a house was left standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      This needless cruelty produced its natural result; Drummond determined
      upon swift and ample retaliation. In the night of December 18th, just one
      week after the burning of Newark, he threw across the Niagara a force of
      five hundred and fifty men. They landed at Five Mile Meadows, three miles
      above Fort Niagara, and marched upon it at once, arriving there at four
      o'clock in the morning. McClure, who had received an intimation of the
      enemy's intention to devastate the American fron<span class="pagenum">163</span><a
      name="link163" id="link163"></a>tier, had gone to Buffalo to raise a force
      to oppose him. The garrison of the fort consisted of about four hundred
      and fifty men, a large number of whom were in the hospital. The command
      had been left to a Captain Leonard, who at this time was three miles away,
      sleeping at a farm-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most elaborate preparations had been made for the capture of the fort,
      including scaling-ladders for mounting the bastions. But the Americans
      seemed to have studied to make the task as easy as possible. The sentries
      were seized and silenced before they could give any alarm, and the main
      gate was found standing wide open, so that the British had only to walk
      straight in and begin at once the stabbing which had been determined upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The guard in the south-east block-house fired one volley, by which the
      British commander, Colonel Murray, was wounded, and a portion of the
      invalids made what resistance they could. A British lieutenant and five
      men were killed, and a surgeon and three men wounded. Sixty-five
      Americans, two thirds of whom were invalids, were bayoneted in their beds;
      fifteen others, who had taken refuge in the cellars, were despatched in
      the same manner, and fourteen were wounded; twenty escaped, and all the
      others, about three hundred and forty, were made prisoners. Some accounts
      say also that the <span class="pagenum">164</span><a name="link164"
      id="link164"></a>women, in the fort were treated with great cruelty and
      indignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the same morning, General Riall, with a detachment of British troops
      and five hundred Indians, crossed from Queenstown and attacked Lewiston.
      The small force of Americans here, under Major Bennett, fought till they
      were surrounded, and then cut their way out through the enemy, losing
      eight men. The village was then plundered and burned, the savages adding
      all the atrocities characteristic of their mode of warfare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Riall next marched his troops through the villages of Youngstown,
      Tuscarora, and Manchester (now Niagara Falls), and plundered and burned
      them all, while the terror-stricken inhabitants were butchered or driven
      away. Nor was the devastation confined to the villages. For several miles
      from the river, the houses and barns of the farmers were destroyed, and
      the women and children either killed or turned shelterless into the woods
      and fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bridge over Tonawanda Creek had been destroyed by the Americans, and
      at this point the enemy turned back, and soon recrossed the Niagara to the
      Canada side.
    </p>
    <p>
      The alarm at Buffalo brought General Hall, of the New York militia, to
      that village, where he arrived the day after Christmas. He found collected
      there <span class="pagenum">165</span><a name="link165" id="link165"></a>a
      body of seventeen hundred men, whom it would have been gross flattery to
      call a "force." They were poorly supplied with arms and cartridges, and
      had no discipline and almost no organization. Another regiment of three
      hundred soon joined them, but without adding much to their efficiency.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 28th of December, Drummond reconnoitred the American camp, and
      determined to attack it; for which purpose he sent over General Riall on
      the evening of the 29th with fourteen hundred and fifty men, largely
      regulars, and a body of Indians. One detachment landed two miles below
      Black Rock, crossed Canajokaties Creek in the face of a slight resistance,
      and took possession of a battery. The remainder landed at a point between
      Buffalo and Black Rock, under cover of a battery on the Canadian shore.
      Poor as Hall's troops were, they stood long enough to fire upon the
      invaders and inflict considerable loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the enemy landed here and formed in battle order, Hall with his raw
      militia attacked both wings and for a short time made a gallant fight,
      especially on the American left, where Lieutenant-Colonel Blakeslie
      handled four hundred Ontario county men remarkably well and disputed the
      ground with great firmness. Both sides had artillery, with which the
      action was opened. As it progressed, however, the <span class="pagenum">166</span><a
      name="link166" id="link166"></a>American line was broken in the centre,
      and Hall was compelled to fall back. His subsequent attempts to rally his
      men were of no avail, and he himself seems to have lost heart; as
      Lieutenant Riddle, who had about eighty regulars, offered to place them in
      front for the encouragement of the militia to new exertion, but Hall
      declined. Riddle then offered, if Hall would give him two hundred men, to
      attempt to save the village from destruction, and at least to bring away
      the women and children, that they might not fall under the tomahawk and
      scalping-knife; but even this the General refused, and the village was
      then left to its fate, though Riddle went in with his own men and rescued
      the contents of the arsenal and some other property.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both Buffalo and Black Rock were sacked and burned, and no mercy was
      shown. With but two or three exceptions, those of the inhabitants who were
      not able to run away were massacred, many of them being first submitted to
      torture and indignity. It is related that in Buffalo a widow named St.
      John "had the address to appease the ferocity of the enemy so far as to
      remain in her house uninjured." Her house and the stone jail were the only
      buildings not laid in ashes. In Black Rock every building was either
      burned or blown up, except one log house, in which a few women and
      children had taken refuge. <span class="pagenum">167</span><a
      name="link167" id="link167"></a>Whether they had the peculiar address
      necessary to "appease the ferocity of the enemy," or were merely
      overlooked, is not recorded. Five vessels lying at the wharves were also
      burned.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this expedition the British lost a hundred and eight men, killed,
      wounded, or missing. More than fifty of the Americans were found dead on
      the field. Truly, an abundant revenge had been taken for the burning of
      Newark. McClure, who had given the provocation for these atrocities, was
      an Irishman, and the absurdity of his whole course in the matter seemed
      calculated to justify the common sarcasms levelled against his countrymen
      for want of foresight.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that the Americans had gained on the northern frontier during the year
      1813, with the exception of the territory of Michigan, restored by
      Harrison's victory, had now been lost, and on New Year's day of 1814 the
      settlers along the whole length of the Niagara&mdash;those of them who
      survived&mdash;were shivering beside the smouldering embers of their
      homes.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hile these costly
      and almost useless campaigns were being fought at the North, the Southern
      States were not without their war experiences, which in some instances
      were quite as bloody. Along the southern Atlantic coast the British had a
      great advantage from their heavy war-ships, which blockaded-the harbors,
      ran into the navigable inlets, bombarded the towns, and sent parties
      ashore to plunder and burn. The militia did what they could to repel these
      incursions, and in some cases, by handling a few pieces of artillery
      skilfully, drove off the invaders. Lewistown, on Delaware Bay, was
      bombarded in April. The shells fell short, and the rockets went over the
      town, but many of the solid shot went through the houses, doing
      considerable damage. In May, a party of <span class="pagenum">169</span><a
      name="link169" id="link169"></a>sailors sent ashore to get water for the
      squadron near Lewistown were spiritedly attacked by militia, and compelled
      to return to their ships with empty casks. A fortnight later a party was
      sent ashore for provisions, but was driven off by the vigilant militia
      before a mouthful had been obtained.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 29th of July the British sloop-of-war <i>Martin</i> grounded in
      Delaware Bay, and eight gunboats and two sloops, commanded by Captain
      Angus, went down to attack her. They anchored within three quarters of a
      mile, and opened upon her with all their guns. The frigate <i>Junon</i>
      came to her assistance, and the cannonade was kept up for nearly two
      hours. The British sailors proved to be very poor gunners, in comparison
      with the Americans. Hardly a shot struck the gun-boats, while the sloop
      and the frigate were hulled at almost every discharge. At length the
      British manned their launches, barges, and cutters, to the number of ten,
      and pulled off to cut out some of the gun-boats at the end of the line.
      Eight of them attacked a single gun-boat commanded by Sailing-Master
      Shead, who used his sweeps to get his craft nearer the squadron, from
      which it had become separated, but all the while kept firing his
      twenty-four pounder at his pursuers, striking one or another of them with
      almost every shot. Finding they were rapidly gain<span class="pagenum">170</span><a
      name="link170" id="link170"></a>ing on him, he anchored and waited for
      them to attempt boarding. He gave them two more gunfuls, as they drew
      nigh, with terrible effect, when the piece became disabled. The barges
      completely surrounded the little gun-boat, and there was a desperate
      conflict hand-to-hand. But of course it could not last long. Shead's crew
      were soon overpowered, and the British flag waved triumphantly over his
      deck. Seven of the British sailors had been killed, and twelve wounded,
      while seven of Shead's men were wounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the Chesapeake the Americans fared even worse. Early in the morning of
      the 3d of May, the British Admiral Cockburn sent a force in nineteen
      barges to destroy the town of Havre de Grace and ravage the country
      between it and Baltimore. A small battery had been erected for the defence
      of the place; but it was still dark when the enemy came, and the first
      notice the inhabitants had of his approach was given by the balls
      whistling through the houses. A panic and stampede ensued. But a few men
      ran to the battery, and fired at the barges till the British began to
      land, when they all joined in the flight, except an old man named O'Neill,
      who stood by one of the guns and continued to load and fire it till, in
      recoiling, it ran over his thigh and somewhat disabled him. He <span
      class="pagenum">171</span><a name="link171" id="link171"></a>still had
      strength to get away, armed himself with two muskets, and tried in vain to
      rally the militia, but finally was taken prisoner. He and his companions
      at the battery had killed three of the enemy and wounded two.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the British forces had landed, fire was set to the houses not
      already destroyed by shells, while the sailors and marines went through
      them, smashing furniture, cutting open beds to feed the flames, insulting
      women, and spreading terror. One house only, filled with women, was spared
      after a special appeal to the Admiral. A church just outside of the town
      was gutted, farm-houses on the road to Baltimore were plundered,
      travellers were robbed, and bridges, furnaces, and mills were destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little villages of Georgetown and Fredericktown, Maryland, were the
      next spoil of the Admiral, who led the ravaging party in person. But he
      did not succeed in landing till his men in the boats had suffered severely
      from the fire of a battery manned by thirty-five militiamen, which was
      kept up steadily for half an hour. Not a house was left standing in either
      of the villages, and the enemy enriched themselves with all the plunder
      they could carry away.
    </p>
    <p>
      About this time Admiral Warren, who had issued <span class="pagenum">172</span><a
      name="link172" id="link172"></a>from Bermuda a proclamation declaring New
      York, Charleston, Port Royal, Savannah, and the whole of the Mississippi
      River under blockade&mdash;a paper blockade, at which both Americans and
      neutrals laughed&mdash;joined Admiral Cockburn, in the Chesapeake, and
      they determined to extend as far as possible the pillaging and burning of
      towns on the coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next one selected was Norfolk, Va. But the approach to the town was
      commanded by a battery on Craney Island, and this battery was promptly
      manned by a hundred American sailors, under command of Lieutenant Neale,
      of the navy, and fifty marines under Lieutenant Breckenridge. It was dawn
      of day on the 22d of June when four thousand British sailors and marines,
      in barges, came in sight of the island; and when they were fairly under
      the guns of the battery, it blazed out. The pieces were served rapidly and
      with such precision that many of the barges were cut clear in two, and
      their occupants would have been drowned had they not been promptly rescued
      by the others. The Admiral was in a boat fifty feet long, called the <i>Centipede</i>,
      and this was so riddled with shot that he and his crew had barely time to
      get out of it when it sank. Before this merciless and unremitting fire the
      squadron of barges at length retreated <span class="pagenum">173</span><a
      name="link173" id="link173"></a>to the ships. At the same time, a body of
      eight hundred soldiers had been put ashore, to attack the town by land.
      But for them a force of Virginia volunteers, under Colonel Beatty, were
      waiting, with a well-placed battery of six guns. The enemy had not all
      landed when the battery opened upon them, with such effect that they
      retreated at once. A part of them took refuge in a house, from which they
      fired rockets at the battery-men; but an American gun-boat came up and
      sent a few twenty-four-pound balls crashing through the house, when the
      last of the enemy fled, making their way back to the fleet as speedily as
      possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smarting under this defeat, the British commanders immediately planned the
      destruction of Hampton, eighteen miles from Norfolk, which they supposed
      would cut off communication between the latter place and the upper part of
      Virginia.
    </p>
    <p>
      At daylight on the 25th, two thousand five hundred soldiers, commanded by
      Sir Sydney Beckwith, were landed several miles below Hampton, and marched
      on the town. At the same time, a squadron of boats, commanded by Admiral
      Cockburn and protected by the sloop-of-war <i>Mohawk</i>, drew up before
      the place and fired in rockets, shells, and solid shot. The entire
      garrison of the place consisted of six hundred and thirty-six men, com<span
      class="pagenum">174</span><a name="link174" id="link174"></a>manded by
      Major Crutchfield, who had seven pieces of artillery.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Cockburn's barges approached the town, fire was opened upon them with
      two twelve-pounders, which did so much execution that the Admiral found it
      discreet to draw off and take position behind a point of land where the
      American gunners could not see him. From this shelter he fired rockets and
      shells for an hour, but so wildly that not the slightest damage was
      effected by them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crutchfield sent a company of riflemen, under Captain Servant, with orders
      to conceal themselves in the woods near the road where Beckwith's column
      would pass in approaching the town, to annoy and delay it as much as
      possible. This was done so skilfully as to inflict considerable loss upon
      the enemy; and when Crutchfield saw that the barges would not approach the
      town again till it was in the possession of Beckwith, he marched with the
      greater part of his force to the assistance of the riflemen, leaving
      Captain Pryor with a few men to manage the battery and keep off the
      barges.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crutchfield's column was fired upon just as the British column had been,
      by riflemen concealed in a wood; and as he wheeled to charge upon the
      hidden foe, he was greeted by a sudden fire from two six-pounders and a
      discharge of rockets. The <span class="pagenum">175</span><a name="link175"
      id="link175"></a>enemy's artillery was so well handled that Crutchfield's
      column was broken up, and a portion of it driven from the field. The
      remainder made its way through a defile, all the while under fire, to a
      junction with Servant's riflemen. At the same time Captain Cooper, with
      what few cavalrymen the Americans had, was annoying the enemy's left
      flank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crutchfield kept up the fighting with spirit as long as possible, but of
      course was obliged to give way at last. Captain Pryor and his men held
      their ground at the battery, preventing any landing from the barges, till
      the enemy's land force came up in the rear and was within sixty yards of
      the guns. He then ordered the artillerists to spike the pieces, and break
      through the corps of British marines approaching in the rear; which order
      was at once obeyed, to the astonishment of the marines, who failed to hurt
      or capture a single man. With Captain Pryor still at their head, the
      little band plunged into a creek and swam across, those who had car-fines
      or side-arms taking them with them, and escaped beyond pursuit.
      Crutchfield in his retreat was followed for two miles by a strong force,
      which failed to overtake him, while he frequently halted his men behind
      fences and walls, to deliver a volley at the approaching enemy and then
      continue the retreat. <span class="pagenum">176</span><a name="link176"
      id="link176"></a>In this fight the British had ninety men killed, and a
      hundred and twenty wounded. The American loss was seven killed, twelve
      wounded, and twelve missing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The village of Hampton was now at the mercy of an enemy who showed no
      mercy, and was immediately given up to plunder and outrage, which
      continued for two days and nights. The town was not burned, but every
      house was ruined as to its furniture and decorations, except the one in
      which the commanding officers were quartered. Such deeds were perpetrated
      by the British soldiers and sailors, unrestrained by their officers, as
      had hardly been paralleled even in Indian warfare. Neither age nor sex nor
      innocence was any protection. In one case an old and infirm citizen was
      murdered in the presence of his aged wife; and when she remonstrated, a
      soldier presented a pistol at her breast and shot her dead. Women with
      infants in their arms were pursued till they threw themselves into the
      river to escape, children were wantonly killed, and such shameful scenes
      were enacted as cannot even be mentioned in a history written for youth.
      The soldiers destroyed all the medical stores, that were necessary for the
      care of the sick and wounded. They also stole a considerable number of
      slaves and sent them to the West Indies, not to be liber<span
      class="pagenum">177</span><a name="link177" id="link177"></a>ated, but to
      be sold and turned into cash. When they abandoned the town, they went in
      such haste that they left behind a large quantity of provisions, arms, and
      ammunition, and some of their men, who were captured next day by Cooper's
      cavalry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The indignation aroused by the unhappy fate of Hampton was such that
      General Robert R. Taylor, commandant of the district, addressed a letter
      to Admiral Warren, inquiring whether the outrages were sanctioned by the
      British commanders, and if not, whether the perpetrators were to be
      punished. The Admiral referred the letter to Sir Sydney Beckwith, who did
      not attempt to deny that the outrages had been committed as charged, but
      said that "the excesses at Hampton, of which General Taylor complains,
      were occasioned by a proceeding at Craney Island. At the recent attack on
      that place, the troops in a barge which had been sunk by the fire of the
      American guns had been fired on by a party of Americans, who waded out and
      shot these poor fellows while clinging to the wreck of the boat; and with
      a feeling natural to such a proceeding, the men of that corps landed at
      Hampton." General Taylor at once appointed a court of inquiry, which by a
      careful investigation found that none of the men belonging to the wrecked
      barge had been fired upon, except one who was trying to escape to <span
      class="pagenum">178</span><a name="link178" id="link178"></a>that division
      of the British troops which had landed, and he was not killed; while, so
      far from shooting the unfortunate men in the water, some of the Americans
      had waded out to assist them. The report embodying these facts was
      forwarded to Sir Sydney, who never made any reply&mdash;which perhaps is
      the most nearly graceful thing a man can do when he has been convicted of
      a deliberate and outrageous falsehood.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the far South a better success attended the American arms this summer
      than either on the Northern border or the Atlantic coast. This was owing
      partly to the greater simplicity of the task that lay before the
      commanders, and partly to the greater energy with which they entered upon
      it, but chiefly to the difference in the enemy. In Canada and on the
      coast, our men contended with forces largely made up of British regulars,
      at that time perhaps the most efficient soldiery in the world. In Florida
      and Alabama they contended indeed with British arms, but they were in the
      hands of Indians.
    </p>
    <p>
      The English agents at Pensacola, with the connivance of the Spanish
      authorities there&mdash;for Florida belonged to Spain till the United
      States purchased it in 1819&mdash;had supplied the Creeks with rifles,
      ammunition, and provisions, and sent them <span class="pagenum">179</span><a
      name="link179" id="link179"></a>on the war-path, not against the American
      armies, for there were none in that region, but against the settlers and
      scattered posts along the navigable rivers. A premium of five dollars was
      offered for every scalp&mdash;whether of man, woman, or child&mdash;which
      the savages might bring to the British agency.
    </p>
    <p>
      The militia of Georgia, Alabama, and Tennessee were called out to meet the
      emergency, and before the year was over the Creeks had been made to suffer
      a terrible retribution.
    </p>
    <p>
      As one body of these Indians, commanded by a half-breed named McQueen,
      started for the interior, a militia force under Colonel James Caller set
      out to intercept them. On the 27th of July they were found encamped on a
      small, low peninsula enclosed in one of the windings of Burnt Corn Creek.
      Caller promptly attacked them, and after a sharp action routed them. But
      he called back the pursuing detachment too soon, the Indians rallied, a
      part of the whites fled in panic, and the remainder had a severe fight
      with the savages, in which they were outnumbered and defeated. Caller lost
      two men killed and fifteen wounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      This victory inspired the Indians with new confidence, while it spread
      terror among the settlers. The next hostile movement was against Fort Mims<span
      class="pagenum">180</span><a name="link180" id="link180"></a>on Lake
      Tensas, near Alabama River, forty miles northward of Mobile. This work was
      a stockade enclosure of about an acre, which a farmer named Mims had
      erected for the protection of his buildings and cattle. It was loop-holed
      for musketry all round, and at one corner was an uncompleted blockhouse.
      When the alarm of Indian raids had gone forth, the settlers flocked to
      Fort Mims from all sides, and Governor Claiborne sent a hundred and
      seventy-five volunteers, under Major Daniel Beasley, to defend it. The
      space was so crowded that it became necessary to extend the stockade, and
      another enclosure was made on the eastern side, but the fence between was
      left standing. On the 29th of August, a thousand Creek warriors, commanded
      by William Weathersford, a half-breed, arrived within a quarter of a mile
      of the fort, and concealed themselves in a ravine. Some of them were seen
      by two Negroes who had been sent out to tend cattle; but when they had
      given the alarm, and a scouting party had failed to find any trace of
      Indians, they were not only disbelieved, but severely flogged for lying.
    </p>
    <p>
      After many false alarms, the occupants of the fort had become incredulous
      and careless of danger, their commander perhaps most so of all. On the
      30th the gates stood wide open, no guard was set, <span class="pagenum">181</span><a
      name="link181" id="link181"></a>and when the drum beat for dinner the
      soldiers laid aside their arms and went to their meal at the moment when
      the savages sprang from their hiding-place and with their well-known yell
      rushed toward the stockade. Officers and men sprang to arms at the
      frightful sound. Major Beasley, in attempting to close the outer gate, was
      knocked down and run over by the foremost of the assailants, many of whom
      poured into the outer enclosure, where they quickly murdered all the
      whites whom they found. Beasley himself crawled off in a corner to die,
      and the command devolved upon Captain Bailey.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Indians attempted to enter the inner enclosure, they were stopped
      by a fire through the loop-holes in the partition. Five of their prophets,
      who had proclaimed that their charms and incantations rendered the
      American bullets harmless, all fell dead at the first discharge. This
      produced a temporary check, but new swarms of the naked savages came up,
      and a desperate fight through the loop-holes was maintained for several
      hours. The soldiers stood manfully at their posts, were assisted by some
      of the women and boys, and killed a large number of the Indians, who, on
      the other hand, were sure of hitting somebody whenever they fired into the
      crowded enclosure. Numbers of the red-skins were constantly dancing,
      hooting, and <span class="pagenum">182</span><a name="link182" id="link182"></a>yelling
      around the fort, many of whom were shot by the old men of the garrison,
      who had ascended to the attic of the largest house and cut holes in the
      roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      The enemy were getting tired of this costly work, when Weathersford came
      up, exhorted them to new efforts, and directed fire-tipped arrows to be
      shot into the fort. In a short time the buildings were in flames, and the
      miserable inmates, driven by the heat, were huddled in one corner, when
      the Indians burst in and rapidly completed the massacre. Children were
      taken by the heels, and their brains dashed out against the walls; women
      were butchered in a manner unknown since the wars of the ancient Jews; a
      few Negroes were kept for slaves, but not one white person was left alive&mdash;excepting
      twelve, who had secretly cut an opening through the stockade and escaped
      by way of the lake. Of the five hundred and fifty-three persons in the
      fort at noon, at least four hundred perished before night; and it was
      believed that about as many of the Indians had been killed or wounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tidings of this massacre of course excited horror and indignation in
      every part of the country, but nowhere met so prompt and practical a
      response as in Tennessee. The Legislature of that <span class="pagenum">183</span><a
      name="link183" id="link183"></a>State called for thirty-five hundred
      volunteers&mdash;in addition to fifteen hundred whom she had already
      enrolled in the service of the general Government&mdash;voted an
      appropriation of three hundred thousand dollars, and placed them under
      command of General Andrew Jackson. * To General John Cocke was entrusted
      the work of gathering the troops from East Tennessee, and providing
      subsistence for the whole. Fayetteville was appointed as the general
      rendezvous, and Colonel John Coffee was sent forward to Huntsville,
      Alabama, with a cavalry force of five hundred men, which by the time he
      arrived there was increased to thirteen hundred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jackson reached Fayetteville on the 7th of October, began drilling his
      men, and on the 11th, hearing from Coffee that the enemy was in sight,
      marched them to Huntsville&mdash;thirty-two miles&mdash;in five hours. For
      the work in hand, he could not have asked for better material than these
      Western pioneers, who were skilled in wood-craft, who knew the tricks and
      manners of the enemy, and were as fearless as they were cunning. Among
      them were Sam Houston and the eccentric and now famous David Crockett.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only serious trouble was in forwarding the
    </p>
    <p>
      * At this time the General was lying helpless at Nashville, from wounds
      received in a disgraceful affray.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">184</span><a name="link184" id="link184"></a>supplies.
      At the most southerly point on Tennessee River, while he sent out the
      cavalry to forage, Jackson drilled the infantry and built Fort Deposit,
      intended as a depot for provisions when the rise of water should allow
      them to be sent down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forty-five miles southward, at the Ten Islands of the Coosa, friendly
      Indians were calling for help against the hostile Creeks. By a week's
      march, in which he foraged on all sides and burned several villages,
      Jackson reached that place. The enemy were in camp at Talluschatches (now
      Jacksonville), thirteen miles eastward, and on the night of November 2d
      Colonel Coffee was sent out with a thousand mounted men and a few friendly
      Creeks, to attack them. At sunrise he divided his force into two columns,
      the heads of which united near the place, while the remainder, swinging
      outward and forward, made a semicircle about the little town. Within this,
      two companies were pushed forward to entice the Indians from their
      shelter. This accomplished, these companies retreated, and the whole line
      opened fire upon the savages and rapidly closed in upon them. "Our men
      rushed up to the doors of the houses," said Coffee in his report, "and in
      a few minutes killed the last warrior of them. The enemy fought with
      savage fury, and met death with all its horrors, without shrinking or
      <span class="pagenum">185</span><a name="link185" id="link185"></a>complaining.
      Not one asked to be spared, but fought as long as they could stand or
      sit." About two hundred Indians were killed, and eighty-four women and
      children were made prisoners. The Americans lost five men killed and
      forty-one wounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point Jackson was joined after a time by the forces from East
      Tennessee under General Cocke, and here he built Fort Strother. But before
      Cocke's arrival he learned that a few friendly Indians in Fort Talladega,
      thirty miles south, were completely surrounded by a thousand Creeks, who
      would soon reduce them by starvation. The news was brought by a chief who
      had disguised himself in a hog-skin and escaped from the fort by night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jackson at once put himself at the head of two thousand men, and marched
      to the relief of the little fort. On the 9th of November he arrived within
      striking distance of the enemy, when he deployed his columns, placing the
      volunteers on the right, the militia on the left, and the cavalry on the
      wings. He adopted precisely the same plan of attack that Coffee had used
      at Talluschatches; but it was not so completely successful, for two
      companies of the militia temporarily gave way, and a part of the cavalry
      had to dismount and fill the gap. Jackson believed that but for this he
      should have killed every <span class="pagenum">186</span><a name="link186"
      id="link186"></a>one of the thousand hostile Indians before him. As it
      was, two hundred and ninety-nine of them were left dead on the field,
      while the remainder were chased to the mountains, and left a bloody track
      as they ran. The loss of the whites was fifteen killed and eighty-six
      wounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Indians of the Hillabee towns, in what is now Cherokee county, sent a
      messenger to Jackson to sue for peace, through whom he replied that they
      could only have it on condition of returning prisoners and property and
      surrendering for punishment those who had been engaged in the massacres.
      But while they awaited an answer, General Cocke, working his way down the
      Coosa, sent a force, under General White, to attack these towns. White
      marched rapidly, destroying everything in his path, and on the 18th of
      November appeared before the principal village, which he at once fell
      upon, and killed sixty unresisting Indians, and carried back with him the
      squaws and children. The Indians, who supposed all the whites were under
      Jackson's command, looked upon this as a piece of treachery, and became
      more desperate than ever. For this unfortunate affair, General Cocke has
      been severely blamed; but he was tried by a court-martial, and honorably
      acquitted, while his own published statement makes it clear that he acted
      in entire good <span class="pagenum">187</span><a name="link187"
      id="link187"></a>faith. He was as destitute of provisions as Jackson was,
      and thought if he pushed on to Fort Strother it would only double the
      number of starving soldiers there.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Jackson was coming down from the north, General John Floyd, with
      nine hundred and fifty Georgians and four hundred Indians, was coming from
      the east. He first found the enemy at Autosse, on the Tallapoosa, thirty
      miles east of the present site of Montgomery, where, on the 29th of
      November, he attacked them, drove them from their villages to holes and
      caves in the river-bank, burned all their dwellings, and then hunted down
      and killed as many of them as possible. At least two hundred fell. The
      whites lost eleven killed and fifty-four wounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Ferdinand L. Claiborne entered the country from the west in July,
      and built small forts at various points. On the 12th of December he left
      Fort Claiborne (on the site of the present town of that name) with a
      thousand men, and after marching more than a hundred miles northeast, he
      came on the 23d to an Indian town of refuge, called Econochaca, on the
      Alabama, west of Montgomery. This village was built upon what the Indian
      prophets assured the tribe was holy ground, which no white man could set,
      foot upon and live. No path <span class="pagenum">188</span><a
      name="link188" id="link188"></a>of any kind led to it. Here the women and
      children had been sent for safety; here, in a little square, the prophets
      performed their religious rites, which are supposed to have included the
      burning of captives at the stake. Several captives, of both sexes, it is
      said were standing with the wood piled about them when Claiborne's columns
      appeared before the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Indians, who had hurried their women and children across the river,
      fought desperately for a short time, and then broke and fled, many of them
      swimming the river and escaping. About thirty were killed. The whites lost
      one killed and six wounded. Claiborne sacked and burned the village, and
      then returned to Fort Claiborne, where his forces rapidly melted away by
      the expiration of their terms of service. Jackson, at Fort Strother, was
      in a similar predicament; and thus closed the year on the campaign at the
      South. It had been attended with many instances of individual bravery and
      exciting and romantic adventure, one of the most famous of which is known
      as the Canoe Fight, of which General Samuel Dale was the hero. There can
      be no better account of it than Dale's own, as he related it some years
      afterward to his friend Hon. John H. F. Claiborne, who incorporated it in
      his "Life of Dale." The General was on his way, <span class="pagenum">189</span><a
      name="link189" id="link189"></a>November 13th, with sixty men, to attack
      an Indian camp on the east side of the Alabama, near what is now Dale's
      Ferry. He says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I put thirty of my men on the east bank, where the path ran directly by
      the river-side. With twenty men I kept the western bank, and thus we
      proceeded to Randon's Landing. A dozen fires were burning, and numerous
      scaffolds for drying meat, denoting a large body of Indians; but none were
      visible. About half past ten A.M. we discerned a large canoe coming down
      stream. It contained eleven warriors. Observing that they were about to
      land at a cane-brake just above us, I called to my men to follow, and
      dashed for the-, cane-brake with all my might. Only seven of my men kept
      up with me. As the Indians were in the act of landing, we fired. Two
      leaped into the water. Jim Smith shot one as he rose, and I shot the
      other. In the mean time they had backed into deep water, and three Indians
      were swimming on the off side of the canoe, working her as far from the
      shore as they could, to get out of the range of our guns. The others lay
      in the bottom of the canoe, which was thirty odd feet long, four feet
      deep, and three feet beam, made of an immense cypress-tree, specially for
      the transportation of corn. One of the warriors shouted to Weathersford
      (who was in the <span class="pagenum">190</span><a name="link190"
      id="link190"></a>vicinity, as it afterward appeared, but invisible to us),
      'Yos-ta-hah! yos-ta-hah!' 'They are spoiling us.' This fellow was in the
      water, his hands on the gunwale of the pirogue, and as often as he rose to
      shout we fired, but ineffectually. He suddenly showed himself breast-high,
      whooping in derision, and said, 'Why don't you shoot?' I drew my sight
      just between his hands, and as he rose I lodged a bullet in his brains.
      Their canoe then floated down with the current. I ordered my men on the
      east bank to fetch the boats. Six of them jumped into a canoe, and paddled
      to the Indians, when one of them cried out, 'Live Indians! Back water,
      boys! back water!' and the frightened fellows paddled back whence they
      came. I next ordered Cæsar, a free Negro fellow, to bring a boat. Seeing
      him hesitate, I swore I would shoot him the moment I got across. He
      crossed a hundred yards below the Indians, and Jim Smith, Jerry Austill,
      and myself got in. I made Cæsar paddle within forty paces, when all three
      of us levelled our guns, and all missed fire! As the two boats approached,
      one of them hurled his scalping-knife at me. It pierced the boat through
      and through, just grazing my thigh as it passed. The next moment the
      canoes came in contact. I leaped up, placing one of my feet in each boat.
      At the same instant the <span class="pagenum">191</span><a name="link191"
      id="link191"></a>foremost warrior levelled his rifle at my breast. It
      flashed in the pan. As quick as lightning, he clubbed it, and aimed at me
      a furious blow, which I partially parried, and, before he could repeat it,
      I shivered his skull with my gun. In the mean time an Indian had struck
      down Jerry, and was about to despatch him, when I broke my rifle over his
      head. It parted in two places. The barrel Jerry seized, and renewed the
      fight. The stock I hurled at one of the savages. Being then disarmed,
      Caesar handed me his musket and bayonet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Finding myself unable to keep the two canoes in juxtaposition, I resolved
      to bring matters to an issue, and leaped into the Indian boat. My pirogue,
      with Jerry, Jim, and Caesar, floated off. Jim fired, and slightly wounded
      the Indian next to me. I now stood in the centre of their canoe&mdash;two
      dead at my feet&mdash;a wounded savage in the stern, who had been snapping
      his piece at me during the fight, and four powerful warriors in front. The
      first one directed a furious blow at me with his rifle; it glanced upon
      the barrel of my musket, and I staved the bayonet through his body. As he
      fell, the next one repeated the attack. A shot from Jerry Austill pierced
      his heart. Striding over them, the next sprung at me with his tomahawk. I
      killed him with the bayonet, and his corpse lay between me <span
      class="pagenum">192</span><a name="link192" id="link192"></a>and the last
      of the party. I knew him well&mdash;Tar-cha-chee, a noted wrestler, and
      the most famous ball-player of his clan. He paused a moment in expectation
      of my attack, but, finding me motionless, he stepped backward to the bow
      of the canoe, shook himself, gave the war-whoop of his tribe, and cried
      out, 'Sam tholocco <i>Iana dahmaska, ia-lanes-tha&mdash;lipso&mdash;lipso&mdash;lanestha.
      Big Sam! I am a man&mdash;I am coming&mdash;come on!</i>' As he said this,
      with a terrific yell he bounded over the dead body of his comrade, and
      directed a blow at my head with his rifle, which dislocated my left
      shoulder. I dashed the bayonet into him. It glanced round his ribs, and
      the point hitching to his back-bone, I pressed him down. As I pulled the
      weapon out, he put his hands upon the sides of the canoe and endeavored to
      rise, crying out, '<i>Tar-cha-chee is a man. He is not afraid to die!</i>'
      I drove my bayonet through his heart. I then turned to the wounded villain
      in the stern, who snapped his rifle at me as I advanced, and had been
      snapping during the whole conflict. He gave the war-whoop, and, in tones
      of hatred and defiance, exclaimed, '<i>I am a warrior&mdash;I am not
      afraid to die.</i>' As he uttered the words I pinned him down with my
      bayonet, and he followed his eleven comrades to the land of spirits. <span
      class="pagenum">193</span><a name="link193" id="link193"></a>"During this
      conflict, which was over in ten minutes, my brave companions, Smith and
      Austill, had been struggling with the current of the Alabama, endeavoring
      to reach me. Their guns had become useless, and their only paddle had been
      broken. Two braver fellows never lived. Austin's first shot saved my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By this time my men came running down the bank, shouting that
      Weathersford was coming. With our three canoes we crossed them all over,
      and got safely back to the fort."

      victories achieved on the ocean in 1812 reversed the opinion the
      Government had entertained as to the value of the navy, and early in 1813
      Congress authorized the building of four ships-of-the-line, six frigates,
      six sloops-of-war, and as many vessels on the lakes as the service might
      require.

    <p>
      But in the second year of the war the American sailor did not meet with
      that uniform success which in the first year had surprised and confounded
      the self-styled Mistress of the Seas. One battle, in which a noble ship
      was lost and many lives were sacrificed, through drunkenness, was a
      grievous mortification to the whole American people. The commander of the
      defeated vessel was fortunate in not surviving the action, as he would
      probably have been court-martialled and disgraced.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first naval engagement of the year took place in West Indian waters.
      Lieutenant James Law<span class="pagenum">195</span><a name="link195"
      id="link195"></a>rence, in the <i>Hornet</i>, of twenty guns, was cruising
      up and down the coast of Guiana, and had taken few prizes, when on the
      24th of February sighted the English brig <i>Peacock</i>, Captain Peake,
      which carried twenty guns. Both drew down upon each other. They passed
      within half pistol-shot; and as they passed, each delivered the full
      broadside of the larboard battery. The <i>Peacock</i> then put her helm
      hard up, intending to wear round and rake the <i>Hornet</i>. But Lawrence
      quickly imitated the movement, got the better of his antagonist, and with
      all his guns blazing bore down upon her quarter. He then closed, and kept
      up so terrific a fire that in fifteen minutes from the beginning of the
      action the Englishman not only struck his colors, but hoisted them in the
      fore-rigging with the union down&mdash;which is a signal of distress. A
      few minutes later, the Peacock's main-mast tumbled.
    </p>
    <p>
      An officer sent on board to take possession found that she had six feet of
      water in the hold, and was settling rapidly. Captain Peake and four of his
      men had been killed, and thirty-three wounded. Every effort was made to
      save the wounded men. Both vessels anchored, for the water here was but
      thirty-three feet deep. The prisoners were removed as fast as possible,
      while, to keep the <i>Peacock</i> afloat, <span class="pagenum">196</span><a
      name="link196" id="link196"></a>her guns were thrown overboard, the
      shot-holes plugged, and the pumps manned; but in spite of this she went
      down, carrying nine of her men and three of the <i>Hornet's</i>. Four of
      the crew took the stern boat, which was supposed so damaged as to be
      useless, and paddled Four others climbed into the rigging of the fore-top,
      and as this remained above the surface when the hull touched bottom, they
      were saved. On the <i>Hornet</i> one man had been killed and two wounded
      by the enemy's fire, and her rigging was considerably damaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      As another British war-vessel was not far away, the <i>Hornet</i> had to
      be put in fighting trim again with all speed, which was accomplished
      within four hours after the action. As she was crowded with prisoners and
      was short of water, she turned her prow toward home, arriving at Martha's
      Vineyard on the the 19th of March, and proceeding through Long Island
      Sound to New York. Congress voted Lawrence a gold medal, and to each of
      his commissioned officers a silver one; and he was soon promoted to the
      rank of captain, and given command of the frigate <i>Chesapeake</i>, then
      lying in Boston harbor. The very next naval battle was the one in which
      Lawrence lost his life, lost his ship, and lost a great part of his
      reputation. <span class="pagenum">197</span><a name="link197" id="link197"></a>Captain
      Philip Bowes Vere Broke, commanding the British frigate <i>Shannon</i>, of
      thirty-eight guns, had been cruising along the New England coast for some
      time, looking for prizes, and especially for an opportunity to retrieve
      the honor of his flag in an encounter with some American war-ship of the
      size of his own. Lawrence was preparing for a cruise against the English
      fleet engaged in the Greenland whale-fishery; but when the Shannon
      appeared in the offing, June 1st, he hastily got his crew together and
      went out from Boston to fight her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Broke had sent in to him a letter containing a formal challenge to try the
      powers of the two ships; but it did not arrive till the <i>Chesapeake</i>
      had sailed, and Lawrence never received it. One sentence of this letter is
      very significant, in that it contains the whole germ of the war. "I doubt
      not that you, equally confident of success, will feel convinced that it is
      only by repeated triumphs in even combats that your little navy can now
      hope to console your country for the loss of that trade it can no longer
      protect." That was it exactly. American trade, the grudge of British
      merchants, and the constant object of British hostilities, was to be
      permitted only so far as American guns were able to protect it; and since
      the American navy, as Captain Broke said, was little, while England's was
      large, it <span class="pagenum">198</span><a name="link198" id="link198"></a>was
      confidently believed by his countrymen that this protection would not
      ultimately amount to much.
    </p>
    <p>
      At six o'clock in the evening the vessels came within cannon-shot of each
      other, and the <i>Shannon</i> opened fire at once. But the Chesapeake
      remained silent till her whole broadside could be brought to bear; then
      she opened her ports, and for eight minutes there was a terrific and
      continuous roar. Now, as before, the Americans were the better gunners,
      and in this broadside firing the advantage was with the <i>Chesapeake</i>;
      but accident favored her antagonist and gave him an opportunity to use the
      advantages he possessed in other respects. Two or three shots that struck
      the rigging of the Chesapeake rendered her for a short time not perfectly
      manageable, and her mizzen-rigging fouled in the <i>Shannons</i>
      fore-chains. This exposed her to a raking fire, and her upper deck was
      swept at once by two of the enemy's guns.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the broadside firing, Captain Lawrence had been wounded in the leg, the
      master was killed, the first lieutenant was disabled, and the marine
      officer, the fourth lieutenant, and the boatswain were mortally wounded.
      So great a proportion of officers struck down was a rare accident. To
      increase the misfortune, a Negro bugler had been substituted for the
      drummer, and when Lawrence ordered the <span class="pagenum">199</span><a
      name="link199" id="link199"></a>signal to be sounded for boarding, it was
      found that the bugleman had crawled under the launch, and when he was
      hauled out he was still so frightened that he could not sound a note.
      Lawrence then passed down verbal orders for the boarders to come on deck,
      and at this moment he fell, shot through the body. As he was carried
      below, he exclaimed: "Tell the men to fire faster, and not give up the
      ship. Fight her till she sinks!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was too late. The enemy were already on his deck in great numbers,
      and after a short and unorganized resistance his men were overcome and his
      ship was captured. The victors considerably increased the casualties by
      firing down the hatchways with musketry, in justification of which it is
      said that some one had fired up the hatch and killed a marine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The havoc in both crews had been frightful for so short a battle. On the
      <i>Shannon</i>, twenty-four were killed and fifty-eight wounded; on the <i>Chesapeake</i>
      forty-seven were killed and ninety-eight wounded. Nearly one third of all
      the men engaged in the action had been struck. Captain Lawrence died in
      four days. His age was but thirty-one. He had been greatly admired for his
      personal bravery, his courteousness, his regard for the sailors under his
      command, and his wonderful nautical skill. <span class="pagenum">200</span><a
      name="link200" id="link200"></a>In explanation of this defeat, it is said
      that Captain Broke had been for weeks giving his men a special training
      for such an encounter; while the <i>Chesapeake</i> had a heterogeneous
      crew, a part of them were new men, and many of the old ones were in a
      state of half mutiny from not having received prize money that was due
      them. Some of the officers were sick on shore, others were inexperienced,
      and several of the sailors were seen drunk in the streets of Boston an
      hour before they were summoned to go on board as the vessel was weighing
      anchor. These facts seem to be well established; but the explanation does
      not make it any the less a British victory. If Broke's men were under good
      discipline, while Lawrence's were not, he is entitled to as much credit
      for his achievement as if it had been accomplished through superior
      courage or any other means. And Lawrence, had he not died, might properly
      have been censured, or even punished, for going out to fight under such
      circumstances, when he could have waited till he had trained his crew. It
      was also said that the sailors entertained a superstitious belief that the
      <i>Chesapeake</i> was an unlucky ship. It was she that had been fired into
      by the <i>Leopard</i>, in 1807, when she had not a single gun in condition
      to return the shot; and just before her battle with the <span
      class="pagenum">201</span><a name="link201" id="link201"></a><i>Shannon</i>
      she had cruised across the Atlantic to the coast of Africa, and home again
      by way of the West Indies, without taking a single prize.
    </p>
    <p>
      Broke's victory was a grateful salve to England's pride, so sorely wounded
      by the naval events of 1812, and her historians have never tired of
      dwelling upon it. One of the latest of them devotes more than eight pages
      to it alone, while he disposes of all the other sea-fights of this war in
      less than three.
    </p>
    <p>
      The American brig <i>Argus</i>, of twenty guns, commanded by Captain
      William Henry Allen, after taking Hon. William H. Crawford to France as
      the new United States Minister at the French court, made a cruise in the
      English and Irish channels, where she captured twenty merchantmen. But in
      the evening of August 13th she had the misfortune to capture a vessel
      loaded with wine. The crew spent most of the night in transferring the
      cargo, and helped themselves liberally to the contents of some of the
      casks. Just before daylight, when all of them were tired out and many were
      intoxicated, they completed their misfortune by setting fire to the prize.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the light of the burning vessel, the British brig <i>Pelican</i>, of
      twenty-one guns, sighted the <i>Argus</i> and bore down upon her. The <i>Pelican</i>
      got the <span class="pagenum">202</span><a name="link202" id="link202"></a>weather-gage,
      and came within close range. The <i>Argus</i> opened with a broadside, and
      for three quarters of an hour the firing was kept up on both sides with
      great spirit. At the end of that time the American had lost her steering
      apparatus and most of her running rigging, while the enemy was lying under
      her stern, firing at leisure. Captain Allen was mortally wounded before
      the fighting had been going on five minutes, and his first lieutenant was
      disabled a few minutes later. There was now nothing for the <i>Argus</i>
      but to surrender. She had lost six men killed and seventeen wounded; the
      <i>Pelican</i>, three killed and five wounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in September the American brig <i>Enterprise</i>, of fourteen guns,
      commanded by Lieutenant William Burrows, was cruising along the coast of
      Maine in search of Canadian privateers, when, on the 5th, near Penguin
      Point, within sight of Portland, the British brig <i>Boxer</i>, of
      fourteen guns, Captain Samuel Blythe, was encountered. Both vessels
      prepared for action, and a few minutes past three o'clock they had
      approached within half pistol-shot, when both opened fire. The wind was
      light, the sea nearly smooth, and the broadsides of the <i>Enterprise</i>
      were very effective. Burrows had mounted a long gun in his poop-cabin,
      running it out of a window, and after the first broadside he drew ahead,
      sheered <span class="pagenum">203</span><a name="link203" id="link203"></a>across
      the enemy's bow, and raked him with this gun. This was repeated, with
      other skilful manoeuvres, and in forty minutes the <i>Boxer</i>, being
      hailed, said she was ready to surrender, but could not haul down her
      colors, because they were nailed to the mast.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of her officers is said to have sprung upon a gun, shaken his fists at
      the Americans, in a fearful state of excitement, and shouted "No! no! no!"
      adding a few opprobrious epithets, when a superior officer ordered him
      down. This exhibition, together with the ridiculous fact that a ship with
      her colors nailed was trying to surrender, brought a hearty laugh from the
      American crew, notwithstanding the shattered spars and bloody decks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Enterprise</i> immediately ceased firing, and took possession of
      the prize. The American vessel had suffered very little injury, though her
      hull was peppered with grapeshot, a ball had passed through her foremast
      and one through her mainmast, and her upper rigging was considerably cut.
      She had lost one man killed and thirteen wounded, three of them mortally.
      The <i>Boxer</i> had been hulled repeatedly, three balls had passed
      through her foremast, some of her guns were dismounted, her top-gallant.
      forecastle was cut away, and her rigging badly injured. The number of her
      men that were killed <span class="pagenum">204</span><a name="link204"
      id="link204"></a>has never been ascertained; fourteen were wounded. The
      commanders of the two vessels both fell, almost at the same moment: Blythe
      cut in two by an eighteen-pound ball, Burrows mortally wounded by a
      canister-shot. They were buried side by side in Portland, with the honors
      of war.
    </p>

      The poet Longfellow, who at that time was in his seventh year and lived in
      Portland, alludes to this battle in his poem entitled "My Lost Youth."

      On the day when the <i>Chesapeake</i> was captured by the <i>Shannon</i>,
      three American war-vessels, under Commodore Decatur&mdash;the <i>United
      States</i>, the <i>Macedonian</i>, and the <i>Hornet</i>&mdash;were driven
      into the harbor of New London, Conn., by a superior force of British
      ships, and so rigorously was the blockade of the port kept up, that not
      one of the three got to sea again during the war. At the same time the
      land defences, manned by Connecticut militia, pre<span class="pagenum">205</span><a
      name="link205" id="link205"></a>vented the blockading squadron from
      entering the harbor to attack them. Decatur made many attempts to get out
      with his fleet, but was always frustrated by the vigilance of the
      blockaders, which he believed was assisted by traitors on shore. He
      declared that whenever he planned an escape, the enemy were warned of his
      intention by blue lights burned at the mouth of the harbor; and from this
      circumstance the opprobrious name of "Blue-Lights" was applied to the
      Federal party, which had opposed the war. It is not unlikely that
      something of this sort was done, either by traitors or by spies in the
      employ of the blockaders; but that the Federal party of Connecticut had
      anything to do with it is sufficiently refuted by the fact that the
      Connecticut militia, largely Federalists, not only protected Decatur's
      vessels when they might have permitted them to be captured, but rendered
      some distinguished services before the war was over, especially in the
      gallant defence of Stonington. Still the Federalists continued to oppose
      the war, though in a hopeless minority as to the whole country, and, like
      all parties out of power, sharply and unceasingly criticised the
      Administration. Their criticisms, too, were sometimes based on pretty
      strong facts, as, for instance, when they ridiculed the idea that it was a
      war for sailors' rights, by quoting an <span class="pagenum">206</span><a
      name="link206" id="link206"></a>official circular to collectors of customs
      which forbade them to grant protections to Negro sailors. Even thus early
      were some of our politicians imbued with the notion that the color of a
      man's skin must necessarily make a vast difference with his rights under
      the government for which he paid taxes and bore arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The freedom of the Massachusetts coast from blockade was a source of
      irritation to the more southerly States; and when in December, 1813, the
      President complained to Congress that supplies were furnished to British
      cruisers, and other contraband trade was carried on through the ports of
      the Bay State, Congress laid a new embargo on the exportation, either by
      land or water, of any goods, produce, live stock, or specie. A similar
      embargo bill had passed the House of Representatives in July, but was then
      defeated in the Senate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up to the close of 1813, the English had captured from the Americans seven
      vessels of war, mounting one hundred and nineteen guns. In the same time,
      the Americans had captured from the English twenty-six vessels of war,
      mounting five hundred and sixty guns.

    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>n the naval
      operations of this, as of the preceding year, privateers played an
      important part. A large number had been commissioned; during the entire
      war, the whole number set afloat was two hundred and fifty-one.
      Fifty-eight of these belonged in the port of Baltimore, fifty-five in New
      York, forty in Salem, Mass., thirty-one in Boston, fourteen in
      Philadelphia, eleven in Portsmouth, N. H., and ten in Charleston, S. C.
    </p>
    <p>
      These vessels were commonly small, or of moderate size, and were swift
      sailers. They carried a few broadside guns; but the peculiar feature of
      their armament was a long gun, generally an eighteen-pounder, mounted on
      the deck and turning on a swivel, so that it could be instantly pointed in
      any direction, no matter what might be the position of the vessel. This
      gun was called Long Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      These privateers not only captured merchant <span class="pagenum">208</span><a
      name="link208" id="link208"></a>ships, but even fought with the smaller
      naval ves sels of the enemy, and sometimes conquered them. And they often
      had a double character, taking cargoes of merchandise for distant ports
      and at the same time being ready to fight on the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was in 1812, as there has been since, more or less sentimental
      objection to privateering, which had come down from the days when
      privateers and pirates were the same. The argument in favor of the system
      was set forth with great clearness by Thomas Jefferson, in an article
      published about a month after the war began. He said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is war? It is simply a contest between nations of trying which can
      do the other the most harm. Who carries on the war? Armies are formed and
      navies manned by individuals. How is a battle gained? By the death of
      individuals. What produces peace? The distress of individuals. What
      difference to the sufferer is it that his property is taken by a national
      or private armed vessel? Did our merchants, who have lost nine hundred,
      and seventeen vessels by British captures, feel any gratification that the
      most of them were taken by his Majesty's men-of-war? Were the spoils less
      rigidly exacted by a seventy-four-gun ship than by a privateer of four
      guns? and were not all equally condemned? War, whether on land or sea, is
      consti<span class="pagenum">209</span><a name="link209" id="link209"></a>tuted
      of acts of violence on the persons and property of individuals; and excess
      of violence is the grand cause that brings about a peace. One man fights
      for wages paid him by the Government, or a patriotic zeal for the defence
      of his country; another, duly authorized, and giving the proper pledges
      for good conduct, undertakes to pay himself at the expense of the foe, and
      serve his country as effectually as the former, and Government, drawing
      all its supplies from the people, is in reality as much affected by the
      losses of the one as the other, the efficacy of its measures depending
      upon the energies and resources of the whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the United States, every possible encouragement should be given to
      privateering in time of war with a commercial nation. We have tens of
      thousands of seamen that without it would be destitute of the means of
      support, and useless to their country. Our national ships are too few to
      give employment to a twentieth part of them, or retaliate the acts of the
      enemy. But by licensing private armed vessels, the whole naval force of
      the nation is truly brought to bear on the foe; and while the contest
      lasts, that it may have the speedier termination, let every individual
      contribute his mite, in the best way he can, to distress and harass the
      enemy and compel him to peace." <span class="pagenum">210</span><a
      name="link210" id="link210"></a>The truth is, privateering is the most
      merciful part of war; for it damages the enemy by capturing property
      rather than by destroying life, and in so doing it throws the immediate
      burden upon the commercial community behind the armies, who have to a
      large extent the power of making war and peace without personal risk to
      themselves, and often exhibit a willingness to sacrifice the lives of
      soldiers with the greatest freedom, so long as their own property is
      secure. Show them that their property is not secure in war, and you give
      them a strong motive for making peace. In modern times, the men who are to
      risk their lives if war arises, generally have little to say on the
      question whether there shall be a war; while those who are to risk their
      ships and cargoes, often have a determining voice. The greater that risk,
      the less the probability of war.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the great powers of Europe drew up and signed the Treaty of Paris in
      1856, they abolished privateering, so far as they were concerned. The
      lesser powers of Europe, and some of those on this continent, accepted the
      general invitation to join in the treaty. The United States Government
      replied that it would join in it, provided a clause were inserted to the
      effect that private property on the high seas, if not contraband of war,
      should be ex<span class="pagenum">211</span><a name="link211" id="link211"></a>empt
      from seizure not only by privateers but by the public armed vessels of an
      enemy. The great powers that originally made the treaty refused to insert
      any such clause; thereby confessing that their object was not to exempt
      private property from the burdens and derangements of war, but merely to
      control the mode of its seizure, and to secure for themselves with their
      large navies an advantage over nations that in time of peace have small
      navies or none at all. So the United States retains to this day her right
      to send out privateers if she becomes involved in war with any maritime
      people.
    </p>
    <p>
      One at least of the London journals, the <i>Statesman</i>, foresaw the
      danger from privateers in 1812. When war was threatened, it said: "America
      cannot certainly pretend to wage a maritime war with us. She has no navy
      to do it with. But America has nearly a hundred thousand as good seamen as
      any in the world, all of whom would be actively employed against our trade
      on every part of the ocean, in their fast-sailing ships of war, many of
      which will be able to cope with our small cruisers; and they will be found
      to be sweeping the West India seas, and even carrying desolation into the
      chops of the Channel."
    </p>
    <p>
      All this, and more, the two hundred and fifty privateers accomplished.
      They cruised in every sea, <span class="pagenum">212</span><a
      name="link212" id="link212"></a>and wrought such havoc with British
      commerce as had never been known before. Coggeshall's history of the
      service enumerates about fifteen hundred prizes taken by them in the two
      and a half years of war, and these were not all of the captures by
      privateers alone; while the government war-vessels, in their cruises,
      added considerably to the number.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fortunes of the privateers were of the most varied kind. Some of them
      made long cruises without falling in with a single British merchantman of
      which they could make a prize. Others took enough to enrich every man of
      the crew. The <i>Surprise</i>, of Baltimore, took twenty in a single
      month. The <i>True-Blooded Yankee</i> was one of the most daring and most
      fortunate. On one cruise she took twenty-seven prizes in thirty-seven
      days. On the same cruise she captured a small island on the coast of
      Ireland, and held possession of it for six days. She also took a small
      seaport town of Scotland, and burned seven vessels in the harbor. A
      partial list of the spoils with which she was laden when she arrived in a
      French port, will give some idea of the business. She had eighteen bales
      of Turkish carpets, forty-three bales of raw silk, weighing six tons,
      twenty boxes of gums, twenty-four packs of beaver skins, one hundred and
      sixty dozen swan skins, forty-six packs of other skins, a hundred and
      <span class="pagenum">213</span><a name="link213" id="link213"></a>ninety
      hides, a quantity of copper, and various other articles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>York</i>, of Baltimore, after cruising on the coast of Brazil and
      through the West Indies, returned home with prizes valued at $1,500,000.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Snapdragon</i>, of Newbern, N. C., captured a brig with a cargo,
      mainly dry goods, worth half a million dollars, and got safely into port
      with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Saucy Jack</i>, of Charleston, took the ship <i>Mentor</i>, with a
      cargo valued at $300,000, and sent her into New Orleans; and a short time
      afterward the same privateer took a brig with $60,000 worth of dry goods.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Yankee</i>, in a cruise of a hundred and fifty days, scoured the
      whole western coast of Africa, taking eight prizes, and came home with
      thirty-two bales of fine goods, six tons of ivory, and $40,000 in gold
      dust; all together worth nearly $300,000.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Leo</i>, of Baltimore, captured an East India-man worth two and a
      half million dollars, which was recaptured by an English sloop-of-war,
      though not till the Leo had taken off $60,000 in bullion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Governor Tompkins</i>, of New York, near the Madeira Islands
      captured the <i>Nereid</i>, with an assorted cargo valued at $375,000.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>St. Lawrence</i>, with a cargo valued at over $300,000, was
      captured and sent into Portsmouth, <span class="pagenum">214</span><a
      name="link214" id="link214"></a>N. H., where she was proved to be an
      English vessel, and condemned, though she had professed to be American.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the most valuable single prize taken in the war was the <i>Queen</i>,
      captured by the <i>General Armstrong</i>, of New York. She carried sixteen
      guns, and was not taken without a stubborn fight, in which her captain,
      first lieutenant, and nine men were killed. She was valued at nearly
      $500,000, but on her way into port was wrecked off Nantucket.
    </p>
    <p>
      One prize contained wine and raisins valued at $75,000; another, $70,000
      worth of cotton; another, $20,000 worth of indigo; another, seven hundred
      tons of mahogany; another $70,000 worth of rum and sugar; another,
      $150,000 worth of gums, almonds, and beeswax; another, $23,000 in specie,
      and still another, $80,000 in specie.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this looks very much like robbery, and in truth it was robbery, unless
      the war, on the part of the Americans, was justifiable. But it is
      certainly more humane to conquer the enemy by robbing his merchants than
      by killing his men; and there can be no question that the exploits of
      these privateers did more to bring the war between England and the United
      States to an end, and prevent another one, than drawn battles, however
      gallantly fought, and futile expeditions against Canada. <span
      class="pagenum">215</span><a name="link215" id="link215"></a>But the
      exploits of the privateers did not consist solely in plundering unarmed
      merchantmen. They were often pursued and attacked by British men-of-war,
      and some of the English packet-ships carried heavy guns, and would not
      surrender without a desperate fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The privateer schooner <i>Governor Tompkins</i>, a few days after the
      capture of the Nereid in December, 1812, gave chase to what appeared to be
      a large merchantman. But she proved to be a frigate in disguise, and a
      sudden squall sent the schooner under her guns before she could change her
      course. The frigate opened fire at once, and her first broadside killed
      two men and wounded six. It also blew up a box of cartridges and set fire
      to some pistols and tube-boxes in the companion-way, all of which exploded
      and went flying in every direction. The schooner's little battery returned
      the fire, but her principal exertions were to get out of the way of her
      powerful antagonist. A chase of two hours ensued, during most of which
      time the vessels were within gunshot and the firing was kept up. The <i>Tompkins</i>
      threw overboard all the lumber from the deck, and two thousand pounds of
      shot, and got out her sweeps, and so escaped. Her captain, Nathaniel
      Shaler, said in a letter describing the action: "The name of one of my
      poor fellows who <span class="pagenum">216</span><a name="link216"
      id="link216"></a>was killed ought to be registered on the book of fame,
      and remembered with reverence as long as bravery is considered a virtue.
      He was a black man, by the name of John Johnson. A twenty-four-pound shot
      struck him in the hip, and took away all the lower part of his body. In
      this state the poor, brave fellow lay on the deck and several times
      exclaimed to his shipmates, 'Fire away, boys! neber haul de color down!'
      The other was also a black man, by the name of John Davis, and was struck
      in much the same way. He fell near me, and several times requested to be
      thrown overboard, saying he was only in the way of the others."
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Boyle, in the privateer <i>Comet</i>, of Baltimore, made a
      remarkable cruise, early in 1813, on the coast of Brazil and in the West
      Indies. On the 14th of January he overhauled a Portuguese brig-of-war
      which was convoying three English merchantmen&mdash;a ship and two brigs&mdash;from
      Pernambuco. Boyle informed the captain that he had no right to do anything
      of the sort, and that he should proceed to make prizes of them. As the
      man-of-war insisted on protecting them, there was a fight&mdash;one vessel
      against four, for the merchantmen were heavily armed. It began at half
      past eight o'clock in the evening, and was carried on by moonlight. Every
      vessel had on a crowd of canvas. The <i>Comet</i> <span class="pagenum">217</span><a
      name="link217" id="link217"></a>ran alongside the ship and one of the
      brigs, and opened her broadside upon both of them. The man-of-war then
      fired grape and round shot into the <i>Comet</i>, which returned the
      compliment, but stuck close to the merchantmen. They frequently separated,
      to give the man-of-war a chance at the privateer, when the privateer would
      pour a whole broadside into them, and then turn his attention to the
      larger antagonist. An hour after midnight, the ship, which had been badly
      cut to pieces and len-dered unmanageable, struck her flag; and soon
      afterward the two brigs, which had been almost as badly damaged,
      surrendered. All this while the man-of-war was hovering near and
      exchanging occasional broadsides with the <i>Comet</i>, till the moon set,
      and it became dark and squally. One of the brigs had been taken possession
      of by Boyle; the other and the ship, assisted by the man-of-war, escaped
      him and made their way back to Pernambuco. On the man-of-war the first
      lieutenant and five men were killed, and several wounded, the captain
      mortally.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 25th of the same month, the privateer <i>Dolphin</i>, Captain W. S.
      Stafford, cruising off the coasts of Spain and Portugal, fell in with a
      large ship and a brig, and fought them both. The privateer carried ten
      guns, the ship sixteen, and the <span class="pagenum">218</span><a
      name="link218" id="link218"></a>brig ten. After a spirited action, in
      which the <i>Dolphin</i> lost four men, she captured both of them, and
      sent them home to Baltimore. The same privateer, in November, was attacked
      just outside of Charleston harbor by five boats from an English
      man-of-war. Captain Stafford tore one of the boats to pieces by a
      discharge of grape-shot, and as the other boats had employment enough in
      saving their unfortunate comrades, the attack failed. The man-of-war then
      fired a broadside at the <i>Dolphin</i> and sailed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The privateer <i>Lottery</i>, Captain Southcomb, while at anchor in
      Chesapeake Bay, February 15th, was captured by nine British barges, in
      which were two hundred and forty men; but not till after a fight of an
      hour and a half, in which the six guns of the <i>Lottery</i> had made
      sickening havoc with the men in the crowded barges. Captain Southcomb was
      badly wounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 11th of March the privateer <i>General Armstrong,</i> Captain Guy
      R. Champlin, of New York, encountered, off Surinam, what she supposed to
      be an English privateer. The <i>Armstrong</i> bore down upon her, fired
      the starboard broadside, wore ship and gave her the larboard broadside,
      and was then about to attempt boarding, but found out that the enemy was a
      frigate, carrying twenty-four guns. The bat<span class="pagenum">219</span><a
      name="link219" id="link219"></a>tle lasted three quarters of an hour, when
      the <i>Armstrong</i> succeeded in getting away. Captain Champ-lin, badly
      wounded, lay on the cabin floor, directly over the magazine, with a pistol
      in his hand, when he overheard some talk about striking the colors. He
      immediately ordered the surgeon to go on deck and tell the men that if any
      one of them dared to strike the colors, he would discharge his pistol into
      the magazine and blow them all up together. In his log-book he wrote: "In
      this action we had six men killed and sixteen wounded, and all the
      halyards of the headsails shot away; the fore-mast and bowsprit one
      quarter cut through, and all the fore and main shrouds but one shot away;
      both mainstays and running rigging cut to pieces; a great number of shot
      through our sails, and several between wind and water, which caused our
      vessel to leak. There were also a number of shot in our hull."
    </p>
    <p>
      The privateer <i>Young Teazer</i> met a singular fate. In June she was
      chased by a British man-of-war. Her lieutenant had been once captured, and
      released on parole, and had gone into the service again without waiting to
      be exchanged. When he saw a probability of another capture, he seized a
      firebrand and ran into the cabin, and in another moment the vessel was
      blown to fragments, and <span class="pagenum">220</span><a name="link220"
      id="link220"></a>every man on board perished, except seven sailors who
      were standing on the forecastle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The privateer <i>Wasp</i>, carrying two guns, had a battle of nine hours'
      duration, on the 31st of July, with the British war-schooner <i>Bream</i>,
      of ten guns. For the last forty-five minutes the action was at close
      quarters, and the <i>Wasp</i> then surrendered.
    </p>
    <p>
      In August the privateer <i>Decatur</i>, carrying seven guns, Captain
      Dominique Diron, was cruising in the track of West India traders, when on
      the 5th she encountered the English war-schooner <i>Dominica</i>, of
      sixteen guns, and after a bloody battle captured her. It was at first a
      running fight, the <i>Dominica</i> firing frequent broadsides, and the <i>Decatur</i>
      answering with her Long Tom and volleys of musketry. After several futile
      attempts to board, Captain Diron succeeded in forcing his bowsprit over
      the enemy's stern, and sending the jib-boom through her mainsail. The next
      moment, while a part of his crew kept up the musketry fire, the remainder
      rushed on board the <i>Dominica</i>, and a hand-to-hand slaughter at once
      began. Men were cut down with swords, and shot with pistols, till the deck
      was covered with the dead and wounded. The English crew did not surrender
      till their captain, G. W. Barrette, was killed, all the other officers
      except the surgeon and one midshipman either killed or wounded, and <span
      class="pagenum">221</span><a name="link221" id="link221"></a>altogether
      sixty men disabled. Of the <i>Decatur's</i> men, five were killed and
      fifteen wounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Globe</i> privateer had a desperate fight, on the 3d of November,
      with two heavily armed packet brigs. Broadside after broadside was
      exchanged at the distance of a few yards, and the brigs were compelled to
      strike. But when the <i>Globe</i> hauled alongside to take possession of
      one of them, she raised her colors again and fired a broadside; after
      which both brigs sailed slowly away, while the Globe, which had lost
      twenty-three men, was too badly crippled to follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The privateer <i>Saratoga</i>, of four guns, captured the English mail
      packet <i>Morgiana</i>, which carried eighteen guns, by boarding. There
      was an obstinate defence, and two of the packet's men were killed and five
      wounded, while the <i>Saratoga</i> lost three killed and seven wounded.
      During the fight the mail was thrown overboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Near the Canary Islands a British sloop-of-war decoyed the privateer <i>Grampus</i>
      under her guns, and then suddenly opened her ports and gave her a whole
      broadside at half pistol-shot. This discharge killed the captain and one
      man and wounded several others, and damaged the rigging badly, so that:
      the Grampus escaped with difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Monday, the 5th of July, the <i>Yankee</i>, a fishing<span
      class="pagenum">222</span><a name="link222" id="link222"></a>smack, was
      fitted out in New York harbor to capture by stratagem the British
      sloop-of-war <i>Eagle</i>. A calf, a sheep, a goose, and three fishermen
      were placed conspicuously on the deck, while below were concealed forty
      men armed with muskets. She then sailed down the bay. The <i>Eagle</i>
      overhauled her, and ordered her to report to the Commodore. Suddenly, at
      the signal word "Lawrence," the forty men appeared, levelled their muskets
      across the deck of the <i>Eagle</i>, and with one volley killed three of
      her men and drove the others below. She struck without firing a gun, and
      as she was taken up the harbor she was greeted by the cheers of a
      multitude of people who were on the Battery, celebrating Independence day.
    </p>
    <p>
      While an American fishing-smack was thus capturing a British sloop-of-war
      in the harbor of New York, on the other side of the ocean the London <i>Evening
      Star</i> was just saying: "The American navy must be annihilated; her
      arsenals and dockyards consumed. The American merchant-vessels ought
      perhaps to be permitted to arm against the pirates of the Mediterranean or
      the Ladrones of China; but, like certain places of entertainment in
      England, they ought to be compelled to exhibit in large letters, on their
      main-sails, <i>Licensed to carry guns, pursuant to a British act of
      Parliament.</i>"

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>t the beginning of
      the third year of the war the prospects of the Americans were more
      discouraging than at any previous period. The European wars had come to an
      end for the time, Napoleon having been overthrown at Leipsic, and Great
      Britain, with an immense navy and an abundance of veteran troops, was at
      liberty to turn her entire attention upon the enemy across the Atlantic.
      Indeed, her fleet on our coast had been gradually increasing for several
      months, and Admirals Warren and Cockburn had shown a determination not to
      confine their operations to combats of vessel with vessel, but wherever
      practicable to send a force ashore to harass the people, burn their homes,
      and carry off their movable property. Harrison's victory was almost the
      only achievement of the American land forces worth mentioning. The little
      navy was as gallant as ever, and had suffered no defeat in <span
      class="pagenum">224</span><a name="link224" id="link224"></a>anything like
      an equal fight, except in the case of the <i>Chesapeake</i>; but now it
      seemed likely to be overwhelmed by a power that could send against it a
      thousand war-ships. Two powerful ones had already been sent for the
      special purpose of capturing one of our cruisers, the <i>Essex</i>, with
      orders to follow her wherever she went, and take her at all hazards. The
      operations of the privateers had struck the English nation in its most
      tender spot, the pocket, and roused it to a furious determination for
      vengeance; while the London journals were boldly talking of schemes for
      using the opportunity to cut off various slices of our territory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the Federal party had declined in popular strength, its leaders in
      Congress opposed the war as bitterly as ever; but after considerable
      debate an act was passed to increase the regular army to sixty thousand
      men, enlisted for five years. A bounty of a hundred and twenty-four
      dollars was voted for recruits, and eight dollars to each man who brought
      in one. Seven hundred men were added to the Marine Corps, half a million
      dollars appropriated for a floating battery, and a hundred dollars offered
      for every prisoner brought home by a privateer. There was a surplus of a
      million dollars in the treasury, and five millions were yet to be paid in
      from loans, while the revenue for the ensuing year was estimated <span
      class="pagenum">225</span><a name="link225" id="link225"></a>at ten
      millions. The expenditures were estimated at forty-five millions, and
      Congress authorized a new loan of twenty-five millions, and a reissue of
      ten millions in treasury notes.

    <p>
      The Russian Government offered its friendly offices as a mediator for
      peace, three times in the course of the war; but each time the offer was
      rejected by England. Once&mdash;in March, 1813&mdash;the offer was
      formally accepted on the part of the United States, and Albert Gallatin
      and James A. Bayard, who believed the English Government would accept it
      as readily, sailed for St. Petersburg, to join John Quincy Adams, American
      Minister at the Russian Court, in negotiating the peace. The London <i>Courier</i>
      probably spoke the sentiments of a large part of the British public when
      it said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "We hope the Russian mediation will be refused. Indeed, we are sure it
      will. We have a love for our naval preeminence that cannot bear to have it
      even touched by a foreign hand. Russia can be hardly supposed to be
      adverse to the principle of armed neutrality, and that idea alone would be
      sufficient to make us decline the offer. We must take our stand, never to
      commit our naval rights to the mediation of any power. This is the flag we
      must nail to the national mast, and go down rather than strike it. The
      hour of concession <span class="pagenum">226</span><a name="link226"
      id="link226"></a>and compromise is past. Peace must be the consequence of
      punishment to America; and retraction of her insolent demands must precede
      negotiation. The thunder of our cannon must first strike terror into the
      American shores, and Great Britain must be seen and felt in all the
      majesty of her might, from Boston to Savannah, from the lakes of Canada to
      the mouths of the Mississippi."
    </p>
    <p>
      The English Government declined the offer of mediation, as before, but
      expressed a willingness to nominate plenipotentiaries to make direct
      negotiations with the American commissioners, suggesting that the
      conference be held in London, unless the Americans preferred Gottenburg,
      Sweden. This answer was made in September, 1813, and reached the United
      States Government in official form in November. The President communicated
      it to Congress early in January, 1814, and the proposition was accepted;
      Gottenburg being chosen as the place, and Henry Clay and Jonathan Russell
      being added to Messrs. Adams, Bayard, and Gallatin as commissioners. Their
      instructions were, to insist on an absolute discontinuance of the practice
      of search and impressment, and to offer, in consideration of this, an
      agreement to exclude British seamen from American vessels, and to
      surrender deserters.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the best way to secure an honorable peace-<span class="pagenum">227</span><a
      name="link227" id="link227"></a>and indeed it will be the only way, until
      the millennium&mdash;is by exhibiting an ability to prosecute successful
      war. With the new appropriations, the Administration, while sending its
      peace commissioners abroad, prepared for more vigorous war within our own
      borders.

      After a great deal of trouble with troops who believed their terms of
      service had expired, and who finally marched home in spite of all
      arguments and protests, Jackson, who had been made a major-general, found
      himself at Fort Strother in January, 1814, with nine hundred raw recruits
      and a few dozen men who had participated in his autumn campaign. With
      these and two hundred Indians he set out on a raid into the country of the
      Creeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 22d, near Emucfau, on Tallapoosa River, he was attacked by a large
      force, who made a feint on his right and then fell heavily upon his left.
      The General had anticipated this plan, and strengthened his left, so that
      after a stubborn fight the enemy were routed and pursued for three miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days later, on the return march, the troops were in the act of
      crossing Enotachopco Creek, when the Indians attacked again. After a few
      shots, the rear guard retreated in disorder, leaving not more than a
      hundred men to face the enemy; but these, by determined bravery, and
      especially <span class="pagenum">228</span><a name="link228" id="link228"></a>by
      skilful use of a six-pounder with grape-shot, defeated the savages, and
      pursued them for two miles. Jackson himself acted as gunner. He lost in
      this raid about a hundred men.
    </p>
    <p>
      In February, Jackson had a new army of five thousand men, including a
      regiment of United States regulars, in which Sam Houston was an ensign.
      The only difficulty now was with supplies; but this was enormous. The
      distance from Fort Deposit to Fort Strother was only forty miles, but the
      roads were so bad that a wagon-train required seven days to accomplish it,
      though there was a horse to every barrel of flour in the load. Nearly
      sixty miles southeast of Fort Strother, and the same distance northeast of
      Montgomery, is Horseshoe Bend in the Tallapoosa, enclosing a peninsula of
      one hundred acres, which is less than five hundred feet wide at the neck.
      Here the Creek warriors, to the number of a thousand, had encamped and
      fortified themselves, when Jackson, with nearly three thousand men, was
      marching against them, for the avowed purpose of extermination. The
      Americans reached the place on the morning of March 27th, and Jackson sent
      General Coffee with the mounted men and Indians to cross the stream two
      miles be low, countermarch, and take position on the bank in rear of the
      village. When he received the signal <span class="pagenum">229</span><a
      name="link229" id="link229"></a>of their arrival, he moved forward with
      his main force, and planted two field-pieces to play upon the breastwork
      of logs and earth which crossed the neck of the peninsula. But a two
      hours' cannonade produced no effect upon it. Coffee and his Indians now
      crossed the river, set fire to the village, and attacked the enemy in the
      rear. As Jackson saw by the rising smoke what had been done, he stormed
      the breastwork in front, and for a little while there was desperate
      hand-to-hand fighting through the loop-holes. Then the troops, following
      the example of Major L. P. Montgomery and Ensign Houston, mounted the
      works, leapt down among the enemy, and plied the bayonet right and left
      till the Indians broke and fled. They neither asked for quarter nor
      received it. Whether they hid themselves in the thickets or attempted to
      swim the stream, they were hotly pursued, hunted out, and mercilessly
      shot. A portion found shelter under the bank, where felled timber and a
      rude breastwork protected them. Jackson summoned them to surrender,
      promising to spare their lives; but they shot his messenger. After he had
      failed to dislodge them either by an artillery fire or a storming party,
      his troops set fire to the timber, and shot the Indians as they were
      driven out by the flames. At the close of that day, five hundred and
      fifty-seven <span class="pagenum">230</span><a name="link230" id="link230"></a>of
      the Creeks lay dead on the peninsula. It is believed that not more than
      two hundred escaped. One chief, Manowa, saved himself after he had been
      badly wounded, by plunging into the water, holding himself under by
      grasping a root, and breathing through a reed that reached from his mouth
      to the surface. After nightfall he rose, swam the stream, and stole away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jackson lost one hundred and thirty-one white soldiers and fifty-four
      Cherokees. Major Montgomery was killed, and Ensign Houston was wounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The savagery of this warfare is explained by the fact that the Creeks were
      not fighting for any cause of their own, real or pretended, but only as
      mercenaries of the English. In a letter written at this time, Jackson
      said: "While we fight the savage, who makes war only because he delights
      in blood, and who has gotten his booty when he has scalped his victim, we
      are, through him, contending against an enemy of more inveterate character
      and deeper design. So far as my exertions can contribute, the purposes,
      both of the savage and his instigator, shall be defeated."
    </p>
    <p>
      By these battles, the power of the Creeks was completely broken. Jackson
      compelled the remnant of the tribe to move north, and that summer they
      were fed by the Government.

      <i>The March to Buffalo&mdash;Capture of Fort Erie&mdash;Battle of
      Chippewa&mdash;Brown's Plans&mdash;Battle of Lundy's Lane&mdash;Siege of
      Fort Erie by the British.</i>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>olonel Winfield
      Scott, who after the failure of Wilkinson's expedition had spent a large
      part of the winter at Albany, arranging with Governor Tompkins the plans
      for the opening year, was made a brigadier-general in March, and with
      General Brown put the army at Plattsburg in motion for the Niagara
      frontier. Brown soon went to Sackett's Harbor, leaving Scott to conduct
      the long march alone. After passing Utica, the route lay largely through a
      wilderness. Where now stands Rochester, a city of a hundred thousand
      inhabitants, there was then but a single log house, and the scenery about
      the Genesee Falls, now closely hemmed in with tall buildings, was
      picturesque with forests and lively with rattlesnakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The army that assembled at Buffalo consisted of Scott's and Ripley's
      brigades of regulars, Porter's brigade of militia, and Hindman's battalion
      of reg<span class="pagenum">232</span><a name="link232" id="link232"></a>ular
      artillery. A camp of instruction was formed at once, the modern French
      system being adopted, and for three months drilling went on every day with
      the most rigid regularity. The commanding General drilled the officers in
      squads, and they in turn drilled the men; after which came company and
      battalion drills, and finally evolutions in line. It is said that Scott
      had but a single copy of the French work on tactics, on which all his
      instruction was based, and this had to be explained to the officers
      individually, most of whom were not able to read French.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late in June, General Brown reached Buffalo, and a campaign across the
      river was planned at once. Early in the morning of July 3d the troops of
      Scott and Hindman crossed the Niagara from Black Rock, landing below Fort
      Erie, while Ripley's crossed a little later and landed above the fort. The
      work was invested, and after the exchange of a few shots, by which four
      Americans and one man of the garrison were killed, it surrendered. A
      hundred and seventy men were made prisoners and sent across the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main body of the British forces, commanded by General Riall, was at
      Chippewa, on the bank of the Niagara just above the great falls, about
      sixteen miles below Fort Erie. A detachment, com<span class="pagenum">233</span><a
      name="link233" id="link233"></a>manded by Lieutenant-Colonel Pearson, had
      been thrown forward as a corps of observation nearly to the fort.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 4th of July the Americans marched on Chippewa. Scott's brigade,
      starting in the morning, led the van, and had a running fight the whole
      sixteen miles with Pearson's detachment. That officer afterward remarked
      that he was surprised at the vigor of the pursuit, and could not account
      for it till he remembered what day it was. When they arrived at Chippewa
      River, it was nightfall, and Pearson crossed it and joined Riall. Scott
      rested or the night on the south bank of Street's Creek, which is two
      miles south of the Chippewa. These two streams flow by nearly parallel
      courses into the Niagara, and on the plain between them the battle of
      Chippewa was fought next day, July 5th. Near the bank of the Niagara ran
      the high road. About a mile west of it was a heavy wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The corps of observation pursued by Scott had destroyed the bridges over
      the small streams as it retreated; and it was assumed by General Brown
      that when he approached the Chippewa, the bridge over that stream would
      also be destroyed. He therefore delayed his attack while materials for a
      new bridge were prepared, so that when pursuit was begun it might not be
      interrupted. But General <span class="pagenum">234</span><a name="link234"
      id="link234"></a>Riall, as it proved, so far from contemplating retreat,
      determined to assume the offensive himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in the day, skirmishing began along the edge of the wood on the
      left, by the light troops and Indians. This at last became so annoying to
      the American pickets, that Porter's militia and the Indians under Red
      Jacket were moved through the woods still farther to the left, to flank
      the enemy's skirmishers. Scouts carried intelligence of this movement to
      Riall, and Porter's force, which began the action in good order, was soon
      charged by a heavy column of British regulars, before which it broke and
      fled.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Brown, who had been at the front watching this movement, seeing a
      great cloud of dust on the left of the British lines, rode in that
      direction and found that Riall was pushing forward his whole force. Then
      he rode straight for the American rear, to hasten up Ripley's troops, who
      were considerably behind those of Scott. Soon after he had crossed the
      bridge over Street's Creek, he met Scott, who was marching over for a
      dress parade on the plain. "The enemy is advancing. You will have a
      fight," said Brown to Scott as he passed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The British were already deployed in the plain, but hidden from Scott by a
      fringe of foliage along the creek. "Nothing but Buffalo militia!" said
      <span class="pagenum">235</span><a name="link235" id="link235"></a>Riall,
      as the American column came in sight, and opened his guns upon it. But
      when he saw them pass the bridge without wavering under a heavy fire, and
      deploy in order of battle, he changed his mind. "Why, these are regulars!"
      he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towson's battery, of three guns, included in Scott's command, was planted
      on the high road, and the British artillery, nine pieces, had a similar
      position some distance to the north. Of Scott's three battalions. Major
      Jesup's was thrown out on the left, Major McNeil's had the centre, and
      Major Leavenworth's the right. The firing along the lines began at once.
      Seeing that by the retreat of Porter his force was likely to be flanked on
      the left, Scott ordered Jesup to move obliquely in that direction, and
      attack the extreme right of the enemy in the woods, which order Jesup's
      men executed, under fire, with precision and success.
    </p>
    <p>
      The British right wing, in conflict with Jesup, became detached from the
      main body, whose right was thereby left exposed. Scott instantly saw his
      advantage and profited by it. He ordered McNeil's battalion to charge
      obliquely upon the broken right of the main body of the enemy, and
      Leavenworth's at the same time to charge obliquely upon its left; the two
      battalions moving as if to unite at a point behind the British line. When
      this move<span class="pagenum">236</span><a name="link236" id="link236"></a>ment
      was made, the opposing lines were within eighty paces of each other, and
      the firing had all the time been increasing in rapidity and
      destructiveness. Two guns of Towson's battery&mdash;for one had been
      dismounted by a shot from the enemy's &mdash;wheeled into a position from
      which they could pour grape and canister through the British ranks, and
      their last discharge before the infantry crossed bayonets was an
      enfilading fire that wrought dreadful havoc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus decimated by the artillery, the enemy's line soon crumbled and broke
      into a disorderly retreat before the steady charge of the infantry. About
      the same time Jesup repelled a heavy charge by a counter charge, and the
      entire body of Riall's forces fled with all haste across the Chippewa,
      Scott's men following closely and securing some prisoners.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a clean victory, gained by hard fighting and skilful manoeuvring;
      and as the battle took place in a plain where there was scarcely any cover
      of any kind for the troops on either side, the losses were exceedingly
      heavy. Just how many men were actually engaged, is a matter of dispute.
      But on the side of the Americans the number appears not to have been over
      nineteen hundred, Porter's troops going out of the action before it was
      fairly begun, and Ripley's not arriving in time to take any part. <span
      class="pagenum">237</span><a name="link237" id="link237"></a>The number of
      Riall's troops in the fight appears to have been about twenty-one hundred.
      The loss of the Americans, in killed, wounded, and missing, was three
      hundred and twenty-seven; that of the British, five hundred and three.
      These are the figures of the official reports, which exclude the Indians.
    </p>
    <p>
      Riall did not tarry long to hold his position on the Chippewa. He soon
      sent a portion of his troops to the forts on the lower Niagara, while with
      the remainder he retreated to Burlington Heights. His Indian allies,
      eighty-seven of whom had been killed, while they had not taken a single
      scalp, all deserted him in disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      This first battle of the new campaign on the Niagara was a great
      inspiration to the American people, showing them that American soldiers,
      if properly drilled and handled, could face and defeat the best troops of
      the British army; for those under Riall at Chippewa were some of the crack
      regiments&mdash;the Royal Scots, the King's, and the Hundredth. An English
      writer said: "We have now got an enemy who fights as bravely as ourselves.
      For some time the Americans cut no figure on land. They have now proved to
      us that they only wanted time to acquire a little discipline. They have
      now proved to us what they are made of, and they are <span class="pagenum">238</span><a
      name="link238" id="link238"></a>the same sort of men as those who captured
      whole armies under Burgoyne and Cornwallis; that they are neither to be
      frightened nor silenced; and that if we should beat them at last, we
      cannot expect to do it without expending three or four hundred millions of
      money, keeping up all our present taxes, and adding to their amount, or
      imposing new taxes. These are the natural consequences of battles such as
      that of Chippewa."
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days after the battle, the Americans crossed Chippewa River, and
      marched on Fort George. On the way, Colonel Stone, of the New York
      militia, burned the village of St. Davids, for which he was promptly
      court-martialled and dismissed from the service. Fort George was invested,
      and then General Brown sent to Sackett's Harbor to procure heavy guns for
      its reduction. But Commodore Chauncey was ill, and it seems not to have
      occurred to him that any other officer could command the fleet for their
      transportation. So Brown, unable to procure siege guns, abandoned the
      siege, and marched back to Queenstown, whence he sent his sick across the
      river, and then prepared for an active campaign.
    </p>
    <p>
      His idea was, to move against Burlington Heights and capture them, then
      continue his march along the northern shore of the lake and capture York,
      <span class="pagenum">239</span><a name="link239" id="link239"></a>and
      thence, still following the lake shore, march on Kingston. But for the
      execution of this plan he relied upon the cooperation of Chauncey's fleet,
      and that he soon found he was not likely to have.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 24th of July he continued his retreat to Chippewa, with the hope of
      drawing out Riall. In the afternoon of the 25th he received information
      that the enemy had thrown a thousand men across the Niagara, from
      Queenstown to Lewiston. Supposing they intended to capture the magazine at
      Schlosser and intercept supplies coming from Buffalo, General Brown
      determined to draw them back if possible by again threatening the forts at
      the mouth of the river. With this purpose, he at once sent forward General
      Scott with thirteen hundred men, consisting of the battalions of Colonel
      Brady and Majors Jesup, Leavenworth, and McNeil, Tow-son's artillery, and
      a detachment of cavalry under Captain Harris.
    </p>
    <p>
      This force, starting about five o'clock in the afternoon, marched down the
      road to the Falls. As they approached the house of a widow Wilson, near
      Table Rock, several British officers were seen to come out, mount hastily,
      and ride away, but not till they had reconnoitred, through their
      field-glasses, the American column. The widow informed Scott that the
      officers were Riall and his <span class="pagenum">240</span><a
      name="link240" id="link240"></a>staff, and that the enemy's advance
      consisted of eight hundred regulars and three hundred militia, with two
      pieces of artillery; the truth being that the force had nearly twice that
      strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scott pressed forward eagerly, throwing out a part of his men to the left,
      and sent back word to General Brown that the enemy was in front. As the
      Americans emerged into a cleared field, they suddenly found themselves
      confronted by the British line, eighteen hundred strong, which was drawn
      up in Lundy's Lane, a road that starts from a point near the great Falls
      and runs westward. In the centre of the enemy's line was a battery of nine
      pieces, which occupied a rounded hillock of gentle slope just high enough
      to give it command of the entire field. Scott saw at once that he was in
      presence of a greatly superior force; but retreat was almost impossible,
      and he judged it best to attack boldly, and trust to Brown for prompt
      reenforcement. As the Americans deployed in line of battle, the hostile
      forces were not more than a hundred and fifty paces apart, and firing
      began at once. The sun was now less than an hour high.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towson's three guns made a gallant fight, but could effect little against
      the nine guns of the enemy, which were served rapidly and skilfully. The
      British left was east of the road that skirted <span class="pagenum">241</span><a
      name="link241" id="link241"></a>the river, and was separated from the rest
      of the line by a space of two hundred yards, which was filled with
      brushwood. Jesup's and Brady's commands, partly hidden by this brushwood
      in the twilight, attacked the detached wing, and after considerable
      fighting forced it back upon the centre, capturing General Riall and
      several officers of his staff, after which Jesup and Brady resumed their
      place in the line. At the same time, the British right wing, which was
      longer than the American left, was thrown forward in an attempt to envelop
      it. To meet this danger, Scott sent McNeil's battalion against it, and
      after severe fighting, with heavy losses, the enemy's flanking movement
      was frustrated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both the messenger sent back by Scott and the sound of the guns announced
      to General Brown what was going on, and he ordered Ripley's brigade and
      Porter's volunteers to advance and join in the action. At the report of
      the first gun, Ripley had put his men in marching order, and when the word
      came to move they moved without a minute's delay. General Brown rode
      before them to the battle-field, and by the time of their arrival it was
      dark. About the same time, the enemy also was reënforced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ripley's brigade formed on Scott's right, and joined in the battle, which
      had not in the least <span class="pagenum">242</span><a name="link242"
      id="link242"></a>abated at the departure of daylight. He soon saw that the
      strength of the enemy lay in the destructive battery that crowned the hill
      in the centre, and called upon Colonel James Miller, of the Twenty-first
      Regiment, to take it. "I'll try, Sir," was the now famous answer of
      Miller, who at once put his men in motion toward the battery. They crept
      silently up to a fence at the foot of the slope, put their muskets softly
      through it, took deliberate aim at the gunners, who had lighted matches in
      their hands, and at a whispered command fired in volley, shooting down
      every one of them. Miller's men then rose, pushed the fence flat upon the
      ground, rushed forward, and cleared the hill of the enemy. Meanwhile
      Scott's men, obstinately holding their first position, had kept on
      steadily firing, receiving as constant a fire in return, and both
      inflicted and suffered heavy loss. McNeil's battalion, having lost its
      commander and every one of its captains, and fired away all its
      ammunition, retired from the field; and a little later, Colonel Brady
      being disabled, his regiment also retired for a similar reason. But a
      considerable number of the men of these two commands joined themselves to
      the regiments that still stood firm, and reentered the fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Miller's capture of the battery, the American line was re-formed,
      nearly at right angles to its <span class="pagenum">243</span><a
      name="link243" id="link243"></a>former position, facing west, and advanced
      so as to hold the ground occupied by the battery. The enemy also formed a
      new line, and for two hours made the most desperate efforts to re-take the
      guns. There was constant firing, aim being taken by the flashes along the
      opposing lines, and more than once the bayonets were crossed in bloody
      hand-to-hand work in the darkness. It is said that at one time the
      continuous blaze of the cannon and small arms made that part of the field
      almost as light as day. During the struggle, both parties were reenforced
      by fresh troops, but Ripley's men firmly held the ground, repelling every
      attack, till the enemy gave it up and retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Brown and General Scott were both wounded, and the command
      devolved upon General Ripley, who, an hour after the enemy had retired,
      withdrew the entire American force from the field, carrying off the
      wounded, and before morning was in camp at Chippewa. As all the artillery
      horses had been killed, the guns for which so costly a struggle had been
      made were left where they stood, and of course they fell into the hands of
      the enemy when he returned next morning and encamped on the deserted
      battle-ground. The principal reason why the Americans abandoned the field
      was, the want of water. <span class="pagenum">244</span><a name="link244"
      id="link244"></a>The whole number of Americans engaged in this battle was
      about two thousand six hundred; the whole number of British, about four
      thousand five hundred. The American loss was one hundred and seventy-four
      killed, five hundred and sixty-five wounded, and one hundred and five
      missing&mdash;almost one third of the entire force. Among the killed or
      mortally wounded were Colonel Brady and Majors Leavenworth, McNeil, and
      McFarland. The British loss was eighty-four killed, five hundred and
      fifty-seven wounded, and two hundred and thirty-five missing or prisoners.
      The action has been called the Battle of Niagara, and the Battle of
      Bridgewater, but the most commonly accepted name is Battle of Lundy's
      Lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ripley soon afterward destroyed the bridge over the Chippewa, and retired
      toward Buffalo. By Brown's orders, the troops were thrown into Fort Erie,
      where they were reenforced, and General Ripley was superseded by General
      Edmund P. Gaines.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he was able to move, General Drummond, who had succeeded to the
      command of the British forces, marched on Fort Erie. A detachment which he
      sent across the river to attack Buffalo was met and defeated at Black
      Rock, but a party in boats captured two of Perry's vessels which were
      moored under the guns of the fort. <span class="pagenum">245</span><a
      name="link245" id="link245"></a>At midnight on the 14th of August, the
      enemy, who had been busy for two weeks planting batteries and occasionally
      bombarding the works, attempted to carry them by storm. The Americans were
      expecting the attack, and the preparations for making it were not more
      careful and elaborate than those for receiving it. The flints were
      withdrawn from the British muskets, both to insure silence in the approach
      and because General Drummond had issued a secret order in which he
      "strongly recommended a free use of the bayonet," and after dark a great
      number of scaling-ladders were carried forward and placed in convenient
      positions. The Americans had their guns charged with grape and canister,
      dark lanterns burning, and every musket at hand and ready for immediate
      use. At one battery, for lack of canister, bags were made of tent-cloth,
      filled with musket-balls, and loaded into the guns.
    </p>
    <p>
      The storming party was in three columns. That which assaulted the American
      left, where Towson's battery was placed, marched up in the face of a
      continuous blaze of artillery and musketry, and, in spite of the storm of
      shot that rolled through it, tried to scale the defences, and actually
      crossed bayonets with the defenders. But in vain. Four such assaults were
      made by this column, and all were <span class="pagenum">246</span><a
      name="link246" id="link246"></a>bloodily repelled. The rapidity with which
      the guns of the American battery were served, making an almost constant
      flash, gave it the name of "Tow-son's lighthouse."
    </p>
    <p>
      On the right of the American works a similar assault was made at the same
      time by another column, which was met in a similar way. Major Douglass
      filled his guns to the muzzle with the bags of musket-balls, and though
      his cannoneers could not distinctly see their enemies, they were so
      familiar with the contour of the ground in front that they knew how to
      sweep it as effectively as if it had been broad daylight. Here also the
      attack failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The central column was a little more successful. The assailants dashed
      forward with their scaling-ladders, and mounted the parapet of the main
      fort, but were met at the edge by the Americans, who in a bloody fight
      hand-to-hand hurled them back. Three times this was repeated, with the
      same result. The column then moved silently around to another point, put
      up the ladders again, and mounted so quickly as to get a foothold within
      the bastion before the Americans could rally in sufficient force at the
      new point of attack to prevent them. Their commander, Lieutenant-Colonel
      Drummond, was at their head, and repeatedly called out to his men to "give
      the Yankees no quarter." Troops were <span class="pagenum">247</span><a
      name="link247" id="link247"></a>rapidly drawn to this point from other
      parts of the fort, and here the bloodiest work of the night was done. The
      highest officers present mingled personally in the fray. Lieutenant
      McDonough, an American, being badly wounded, asked for quarter, which
      Drummond refused, at the same time repeating his order to his men to
      refuse it in all cases. McDonough roused himself for one more effort,
      seized a handspike, and kept several assailants at bay, till Drummond
      disabled him with a pistol-shot. An American who saw this at once shot
      Colonel Drummond through the breast, and followed the shot with a
      bayonet-thrust. The Colonel had in his pocket a copy of General Drummond's
      secret order, and the bayonet passed through the sentence in which "a free
      use of the bayonet" was recommended. *
    </p>
    <p>
      At daylight the enemy still held the bastion he had gained in the night,
      and several determined attempts to dislodge him failed, though the number
      of men he had thrown into it was being continually reduced by an irregular
      fire directed upon it. The British reserve was now brought up to reenforce
      the party in the bastion, while Douglass turned the guns of his battery so
      as to sweep diagonally the

      * This blood-stained document is now in the possession of the New York
      Historical Society.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">248</span><a name="link248" id="link248"></a>ground
      over which it must pass, and Fanning's battery was already playing upon
      the enemy with considerable effect. But at the moment when the reserves
      were ready to make a rush for the bastion, there was a tremendous
      explosion, and the platform of the bastion, with all the men upon it, was
      hurled into the air. Masses of earth, stones, broken timbers, and dead and
      living bodies of men rose two hundred feet, and in falling were scattered
      to a great distance. It was a chest of ammunition that had exploded; but
      how it happened is unknown. Some of the American officers present believed
      it to be purely accidental, others said that Lieutenant McDonough, lying
      wounded at the foot of the bastion, being exasperated at the treatment he
      had received, applied the match and sacrificed himself for the sake of
      defeating his barbarous foe. The British reserves at once fell back, the
      contest was abandoned, and the shattered columns returned to their camp.
      According to General Drummond's official report, his loss in killed,
      wounded, and missing, was nine hundred and five. But as he gives the
      number of his killed as only fifty-eight, while the Americans found two
      hundred and twenty-two British soldiers dead on the field, it may be that
      even his acknowledged total loss of nearly a thousand is an
      understatement. The Americans lost eighty-four, besides <span
      class="pagenum">249</span><a name="link249" id="link249"></a>forty-five
      men disabled by the cannonade that preceded the night assault.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Gaines set to work at once to rebuild the ruined bastion and
      strengthen the whole line of works, while the enemy, after receiving
      reenforcements, began a siege by regular approaches. They soon brought
      their parallels so close that they were able to throw shells and hot shot
      into the fort every day. One shell descended through the roof of General
      Gaines's headquarters, and exploded at his feet, so injuring him that he
      was forced to give up the command to General Brown, and retire to Buffalo.
      The Americans in the fort, as well as the besiegers, had been reenforced,
      and General Brown planned a grand sortie to break up the siege works. The
      enemy's camp was two miles in the rear, and one third of his force was
      thrown forward at a time to work on the parallels. The Americans secretly
      marked out a road through the woods, leading from their left around to a
      point close upon the right of the besiegers. On the 17th of September two
      columns, of about one thousand men each, sallied out from the fort. One
      column followed the road through the woods and suddenly burst upon the
      British right, while the other marched through a ravine, against the
      centre. Before reënforcements could come from the British camp, the
      Americans <span class="pagenum">250</span><a name="link250" id="link250"></a>leaped
      into the siege works, after bloody fighting overcame all resistance,
      dismounted the guns and rendered them useless, exploded the magazines, and
      returned to the fort with many prisoners. This operation cost the
      Americans five hundred and twenty men, killed, wounded, or missing, and
      the British six hundred and nine.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the night of the 21st, General Drummond raised the siege, and retired
      beyond the Chippewa. In October the Americans dismantled Fort Erie, and
      returned to the eastern shore of the Niagara.

    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>n February General
      Wilkinson had removed his army from French Mills to Plattsburg, on Lake
      Champlain, and a month later he added one more to the futile invasions of
      Canada. At the head of four thousand men, he crossed the border, March
      30th, met a party of British at Odelltown, with whom skirmishing was
      carried on for three miles along the road, and found the enemy seriously
      in his path at La Colle Mill, on the Sorel, four miles from Rouse's Point,
      where about two hundred men were posted in a stone mill and a block-house,
      on either side of La Colie Creek.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilkinson brought up two pieces of artillery and planted them within two
      hundred yards of the stone mill. Then he disposed his forces in such a way
      as nearly to surround it and cut off the retreat of the enemy when his
      guns should knock the walls of the <span class="pagenum">252</span><a
      name="link252" id="link252"></a>mill about their heads. But though the
      guns were served with great skill and rapidity for two hours, the walls
      would n't budge, and it did not occur to the enemy to attempt a retreat.
      On the contrary, from their secure position they used their rifles so
      effectively that Wilkinson's men suffered severely. Captain McPherson,
      commanding the battery, was wounded in the chin, but tied it up with his
      handkerchief and remained at his post till another shot broke his thigh,
      when he was borne off. His successor, Lieutenant Larrabee, was soon shot
      through the lungs, when he also was borne to the rear; and Lieutenant
      Sheldon then kept the battery in play till the close of the fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Hancock, commanding the enemy, having received reënforcements that
      swelled the number of his men to about a thousand, ordered a sortie, to
      capture the battery. His troops suddenly burst from the mill, and made a
      rush for the guns. But this subjected them to a fire from the American
      infantry, by which they suffered heavily, and they were obliged to return
      to the mill and the blockhouse. A second and more desperate sortie had the
      same result, and the enemy then shut themselves up in the house and defied
      all attempts to drive them out. As the condition of the roads prevented
      him from bringing up heavier artillery, Wil<span class="pagenum">253</span><a
      name="link253" id="link253"></a>kinson gave up the expedition and returned
      through mud, snow, and rain to Plattsburg. The affair had cost him a
      hundred and fifty-four men, and inflicted on the enemy a loss of
      sixty-one. The General asked for a court-martial, and was tried and
      acquitted; but this ended his military career. General George Izard
      succeeded to his command.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both belligerents were still building ships for service on Lake Ontario.
      The British had a large one on the stocks at Kingston, and the Americans
      an equally large one at Sackett's Harbor. All sorts of insignificant
      affairs took place during the spring and summer along the shores of this
      lake and Lake Champlain, effecting nothing, but keeping the people in a
      state of alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      On one occasion three boats approached Sackett's Harbor, carrying two
      barrels of powder, with which it was intended to blow up the new vessel on
      the stocks. But they were discovered and fired at, whereupon the crews
      hastily threw the powder overboard, fearing it would be exploded by a
      bullet, and pulled away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding that he could not destroy the new ship, Sir James Yeo determined
      to render her useless by capturing the guns, rigging, and stores intended
      for her, which were at Oswego. Accordingly he organized an expedition of
      about three thousand men, <span class="pagenum">254</span><a name="link254"
      id="link254"></a>the troops being commanded by General Drummond, and
      sailed for that place early in May. The fort at Oswego, an old affair, in
      a dilapidated condition, was on one side of the river, and the village-on
      the other. Lieutenant-Colonel Mitchell, commanding at the fort, saw the
      approaching expedition early in the morning of May 5th. As his force was
      too small to be divided, he sent a large number of tents across the river,
      and had them pitched in front of the village. This convinced the enemy
      that there was a heavy force on that side of the river, and he confined
      his attention to the fort.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ships bombarded the work, and a force attempted to land by means of
      boats. But Colonel Mitchell sent a few men down the shore with one old
      gun, and as soon as they came within range it made such havoc among the
      boats' crews that they pulled back to the fleet. One of the boats, sixty
      feet long, propelled by three sails and thirty-six oars, was so shattered
      that it was abandoned and drifted ashore.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day the fleet returned to the attack, and this time succeeded in
      landing about two thousand men. Colonel Mitchell, who had been reenforced
      by a small body of militia, gradually retired before the invaders, making
      a gallant resistance as long as it was of any use, and then retreated to a
      point several miles up the river, whither most of <span class="pagenum">255</span><a
      name="link255" id="link255"></a>the stores had been removed, and destroyed
      the bridges behind him. The enemy raised and carried away the schooner <i>Growler</i>,
      which, as it contained some of the guns for the new vessel, the Americans
      had sunk on the approach of the expedition; burned the barracks, took
      whatever he could find that was movable, and on the 7th sailed away. The
      action had cost him two hundred and thirty-five men, killed, wounded, or
      drowned. The Americans had lost sixty-nine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five days later a British squadron appeared before Charlotte, at the mouth
      of Genesee River. The village was guarded by sixty men, with one
      field-piece. Word was sent to General Peter B. Porter, who arrived on the
      morning of the 13th, just in time to refuse a demand for the surrender of
      the place. Two gunboats then entered the river and bombarded the town for
      an hour and a half, throwing in shells, rockets, and round shot. The women
      and children were removed, a militia force of three hundred and fifty men
      was collected, and dispositions were made to capture the boats if they
      should venture farther up the river. A second demand for a surrender, with
      a threat to land twelve hundred men and destroy the village, was refused
      by Porter, and on the 15th the boats bombarded the place again for some
      hours, and then withdrew. <span class="pagenum">256</span><a name="link256"
      id="link256"></a>In the evening the squadron sent a force on shore at
      Poultneyville, where some stores were captured; but a small body of
      militia under General John Swift soon appeared and drove the enemy
      precipitately back to their boats.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Sir James Yeo was blockading Sackett's Harbor for the special purpose
      of preventing the armament of the new vessel from being carried in, the
      wits of the Americans were taxed to get the guns and cables there.
      Transportation all the way by land would have been tedious and costly. The
      task was assigned to Captain Woolsey, of the navy. He caused a story to be
      circulated, in a way that made it sure to reach the vigilant enemy, that
      the guns were to be transported by way of Oneida Lake. They were on
      nineteen boats, and on the 28th of May he ran the rapids and arrived at
      Oswego with them at dusk. The plan was, to coast along down the lake as
      far as Sandy Creek, eight miles from Sackett's Harbor, run up the creek,
      and thence carry them overland. Accompanied by a hundred and twenty
      riflemen, under Major Appling, the flotilla went down the lake by night as
      far as Big Salmon River, and in the morning one boat was missing. At this
      point a body of Oneida Indians joined the expedition, and at noon on the
      29th it reached Sandy Creek. The missing boat had gone <span
      class="pagenum">257</span><a name="link257" id="link257"></a>on to
      Sackett's Harbor, where&mdash;perhaps purposely&mdash;it fell into the
      hands of the blockaders, to whom its crew told the whole story of
      Woolsey's flotilla. Sir James at once sent a force, in two gunboats and
      four smaller craft, to capture it. This expedition sailed up Sandy Creek
      on the morning of the 30th, thinking to make sure prize of the flotilla
      and its cargo of guns and cables. But Major Appling had placed his
      riflemen in ambush along the bank, and near the flotilla was Captain
      Melville with a company of light artillery and two six-pounders. The
      enemy's gunboats opened fire on the flotilla as fast as they came within
      gunshot, and a party of troops was landed. As soon as they were within
      range of Appling's rifles, he poured in a deadly fire upon their flank and
      rear, while at the same time the artillery played upon them in front. In
      ten minutes the British lost eighteen men killed and fifty wounded, when
      the whole force surrendered. The captured boats mounted seven guns, and
      there were a hundred and sixty-five prisoners. The Americans had two men
      wounded. The Indians took no active part in the fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      This affair inflicted so serious a loss upon the British fleet that it
      returned to Kingston, and remained there till another ship and more men
      could be obtained. The Americans arrived safely at <span class="pagenum">258</span><a
      name="link258" id="link258"></a>Sackett's Harbor with their guns, and the
      new frigate, the <i>Mohawk</i>, was launched on the 11th of June.
      Chauncey's squadron then consisted of nine vessels, mounting two hundred
      and fifty-one guns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in August, General Izard, being ordered to relieve General Brown in
      the command on the Niagara frontier, marched from Plattsburg with about
      four thousand troops, leaving General Alexander Macomb in command there
      with twelve hundred, including the invalids. After his arrival at Buffalo,
      Izard crossed the Niagara with about eight thousand men, and set forward
      to attack Drummond on the Chippewa. But the British commander, after one
      sharp skirmish, withdrew his forces to Fort George and Burlington Heights.
      Izard, who lacked the energy to follow, persuaded himself, in spite of the
      almanac, that the season was far advanced, and retired to Black Rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another American expedition on the upper lakes was not more satisfactory
      or creditable in its result. It was intended for the re-capture of
      Michilimackinac, the first place taken by the British during the war. The
      garrison was strengthened in April, 1814, and three months later a
      detachment sent out from it captured the American post at Prairie du
      Chien.
    </p>
    <p>
      The naval portion of the expedition was entrusted to Commander Arthur St.
      Clair, who had five ves<span class="pagenum">259</span><a name="link259"
      id="link259"></a>sels which had formed part of Perry's fleet. He took on
      board five hundred regular troops and about the same number of militia,
      commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Croghan, who had made the gallant defence
      of Fort Stephenson the year before, sailed on the 12th of July, and
      arrived at Michilimackinac on the 26th. There was a difference of opinion
      as to the best mode of attack; St. Clair was unwilling to attempt it first
      with his vessels, because the fort was so far above the water that it
      could send a plunging fire upon their decks.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 4th of August the troops were landed on the north side of the
      island, to attack the fort in the rear. But Lieutenant-Colonel McDonall,
      who commanded it, had drawn out his entire garrison, and taken up a strong
      position in the path of the Americans. His men were behind a small ridge
      which formed a natural breastwork, the ground in front was perfectly
      clear, and two field-pieces commanded it. On each of their flanks was a
      thick wood, and in these woods McDonall posted a force of Indians. Croghan
      advanced with his militia in front, and attempted to turn the British
      left. But a volley from the Indians in the woods, whom he had not
      discovered, killed Major Holmes, wounded Captain Desha, and threw the
      American right wing into confusion. Croghan then attacked the enemy's
      <span class="pagenum">260</span><a name="link260" id="link260"></a>centre,
      and drove him from his breastwork into the woods in his rear. But beyond
      this point it seemed impossible to accomplish anything, and the Americans
      soon withdrew from the field and reembarked. They had lost thirteen men
      killed, fifty-two wounded, and two missing. The British loss is unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      But while these insignificant actions were taking place along the whole
      length of the lakes, a serious danger threatened the country at the
      eastern extremity of that line, and was averted by a brilliant victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The British troops at the foot of Lake Champlain had been heavily
      reenforced by veterans from the armies that had conquered Napoleon, and
      Sir George Prevost, who had been ordered to make an invasion of New York
      by the route taken by Burgoyne in 1777, seized the opportunity when the
      Americans at Plattsburg were weakened by the absence of Izard and the four
      thousand men he had taken with him to the Niagara frontier.
    </p>
    <p>
      The object of the movement was, to capture and hold a portion of the State
      of New York; so that when the pending peace negotiations were brought to a
      close, it might be stipulated that all territory should remain with the
      party in whose possession it then was, and this would give the English
      complete <span class="pagenum">261</span><a name="link261" id="link261"></a>control
      of the St. Lawrence and Lake Champlain, if not of Lake Ontario also. In
      accordance with this purpose, Prevost issued a proclamation to the
      inhabitants of that sparsely settled region, calling upon them to renounce
      allegiance to the United States, renew their allegiance to Great Britain,
      and furnish his troops subsistence. Had his forces been victorious, he
      would have claimed that this had been done, and the English would then
      probably have been successful in their purpose to "change the boundary of
      New York."
    </p>
    <p>
      General Alexander Macomb, who had been left in command at Plattsburg on
      the departure of General Izard, and had been told by that officer that he
      must expect to be driven out or made a prisoner by the enemy, had made up
      his mind to falsify the prediction, and exhibited wonderful energy in
      putting the place into a defensible condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saranac River, after running parallel with the shore of Lake Champlain for
      a short distance, turns sharply to the east and flows into Cumberland or
      Plattsburg Bay. On the peninsula thus enclosed, which is about half a mile
      wide, the Americans constructed three redoubts and two block-houses, one
      of them being at the mouth of the river. The north bank is about thirty
      feet high; and the south bank, which was the one occupied by the Ameri<span
      class="pagenum">262</span><a name="link262" id="link262"></a>cans, about
      fifty. Macomb had fifteen hundred regulars, and two thousand militia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prevost, with fourteen thousand troops, began his advance on the 29th of
      August, crossed the border on the 1st of September, and thenceforth found
      his march impeded somewhat by felled trees and broken bridges. He was in
      no great hurry, however, as he was in advance of the fleet, commanded by
      Commodore George Downie, on whose cooperation he relied. He impressed the
      horses of farmers along the route for the transportation of his artillery
      and supplies, and arrived before Plattsburg on the 6th. The advance of his
      right column was assaulted by a small body of riflemen under Major John E.
      Wool, who inflicted some loss and drove it back upon the main body. Wool
      fell back, was joined by Captain Leonard's battery, made another stand,
      inflicted more loss with the artillery, and again fell back slowly till he
      crossed the Saranac, destroying the bridge behind him. The enemy's left
      column, approaching by a road nearer the lake, was annoyed by skirmishers
      under Lieutenant-Colonel Appling, and by the American gun-boats. Both
      bridges were destroyed, and when the enemy's riflemen posted themselves in
      several houses on the north bank, these were set on fire by hot shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the British fleet had not yet come up, and <span class="pagenum">263</span><a
      name="link263" id="link263"></a>Prevost, while waiting for it, spent
      several days in erecting batteries and perfecting his preparations for a
      serious assault. The fleet appeared on the morning of the nth, and the
      General gave orders for an immediate advance.
    </p>
    <p>
      His men attempted to ford the river at three places&mdash;where the two
      bridges had been, and at a point farther up, known as Pike's Cantonment
      &mdash;their movements being covered by a heavy fire from the British
      batteries. The troops that actually advanced to the assault numbered eight
      thousand, and they carried an immense number of scaling-ladders, to enable
      them to climb the high bank and afterward surmount the American works.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the lower bridge, the fire from the forts and block-houses drove them
      back. At the upper bridge, they were prevented from landing by a steady
      fire of musketry. At Pike's Cantonment, where the river was easily
      fordable, there was only militia to dispute the passage. Yet several
      attempts to cross were repelled; and when finally a body of regulars
      succeeded in crossing, the militia rallied and drove it back again with
      heavy loss. At this point of time the issue of the battle had been decided
      by the action on the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      The American flotilla, commanded by Lieutenant Thomas Macdonough, was
      drawn up in line to await <span class="pagenum">264</span><a name="link264"
      id="link264"></a>the attack, in such manner that the British ships could
      not enter the bay without being exposed to a broadside fire. Macdonough's
      vessels were all stationed with their prows to the north, the <i>Eagle</i>,
      of twenty guns, at the head of the line; then the <i>Saratoga</i>,
      flag-ship, of twenty-six guns; then the <i>Ticonderoga</i>, of seventeen;
      and lastly the <i>Preble</i>, of seven, which was so near a shoal that the
      enemy could not pass around her. Macdonough also had ten galleys or
      gun-boats, which he placed inside of his line, opposite the intervals
      between the larger vessels. The British flotilla also consisted of four
      large vessels&mdash;carrying respectively thirty-seven, sixteen, eleven,
      and eleven guns&mdash;and twelve gun-boats. The total American force was
      fourteen vessels, with eighty-six guns and eight hundred and fifty men;
      the total British force, sixteen vessels, with ninety-five guns and one
      thousand and fifty men.
    </p>
    <p>
      The peculiar thing in Macdonough's preparations, and the one perhaps which
      secured him the victory, was an arrangement by which he made it possible
      to turn his flag-ship almost instantly so as to bring her broadside to
      bear on any point. He did this by laying a kedge anchor broad off each of
      her bows, and carrying the hawsers to the quarters. Thus by winding in one
      or the other of the hawsers the stern of the ship could be swung one way
      or the other, <span class="pagenum">265</span><a name="link265"
      id="link265"></a>while the cable of the main anchor kept her bow in one
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The English line bore down upon the American in fine style, the first two
      vessels firing as they approached. The flag-ship <i>Confiance</i> did not
      open fire till she had dropped anchor within a quarter of a mile of her
      foe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Eagle</i>, at the head of the American line, began firing in a wild
      way, without orders, before her shot could reach the enemy. The excitement
      was soon felt through the fleet, and was shared by a young cock which had
      escaped from his coop on the deck of the <i>Saratoga</i>. In response to
      the boom of the cannon, he flew upon a gun-slide, flapped his wings, and
      crowed loudly. The sailors burst into a hearty laugh, and gave three
      cheers. Then a long gun, sighted by Macdonough himself, was fired, and as
      the shot raked the deck of the <i>Confiance</i>, the whole line opened and
      the battle became general. The first broadside from the <i>Confiance</i>
      disabled forty men on the <i>Saratoga</i>; for fifteen minutes everything
      was ablaze, and the roar was continuous. Then the vessel at the head of
      the British line struck her colors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The enemy's shot cut away the <i>Eagle's</i> springs&mdash;ropes fastened
      either to the anchor or to the cable, and passed to the quarter, in order
      to sway the ship <span class="pagenum">266</span><a name="link266"
      id="link266"></a>to one side or the other and bring the guns to bear on
      any desired point. Her commander, Lieutenant Henley, then cut his cable,
      sheeted home the topsails, ran down behind the <i>Saratoga</i>, and took a
      position between her and the <i>Ticonderoga</i>, anchoring by the stern,
      which brought the fresh guns of his larboard battery to bear on the enemy,
      when they were served with good effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Preble</i> was attacked by the enemy's gunboats, and driven from
      her position; but they were stopped by the next in line, which they vainly
      tried to board. Every gun of the starboard battery&mdash;-the side nearest
      the enemy&mdash;on the American flag-ship was disabled. Then Macdonough
      proceeded to "wind ship," that is, to turn the vessel completely round by
      winding at the hawsers attached to the kedges. This was accomplished
      without accident, and his gunners, springing to the larboard battery,
      poured out fresh broadsides that made dreadful havoc with the <i>Confiance</i>.
      The commander of that vessel attempted to copy Macdonough's manoeuvre, for
      her battery on the side presented to the enemy was also nearly used up,
      but failed, and two hours and a quarter after the fight began her colors
      came down. The remaining British vessels also surrendered, and the victory
      was complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the tremendous cheer that burst from the <span class="pagenum">267</span><a
      name="link267" id="link267"></a>sailors of the American fleet announced
      this news, to friend and foe on shore, Sir George Prevost&mdash;who from
      the first had relied more upon the fleet than upon his army&mdash;gave up
      his whole plan, and made all haste to return to Canada.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this bloody battle&mdash;which defeated what is known as the second
      invasion of New York, and preserved our territory intact&mdash;the
      American fleet suffered a loss of fifty two men killed and fifty-eight
      wounded. The British, according to their official report, lost fifty-seven
      killed, including Commodore Downie, and seventy-two wounded; Macdonough
      reported their loss at eighty-four killed and a hundred and ten wounded.
      The British galleys, before the Americans could take possession of them,
      drifted out into the lake, and escaped.

      of the Frigate Adams&mdash;Bombardment of Stonington&mdash;Affairs at
      Wareham, Scituate, and Boothbay.</i>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he close of the
      war in Europe had not only enabled the English to strengthen their land
      forces in America, but had also liberated many of their warships, and the
      result was felt all along our coast. The enemy's purpose to conquer
      territory which might be retained after the war, apparent enough before,
      was now definitely proclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In July, Sir Thomas Hardy, commander of the British fleet before New
      London, received orders to capture Moose Island, in Passamaquoddy Bay, and
      sailed thither with five ships of war and transports containing about
      fifteen hundred troops. The Americans had here a small fort, garrisoned by
      only fifty men, under Major Putnam, who made no resistance to the enemy,
      but surrendered at once, July 11th. Sir Thomas then took formal possession
      not only of the town of Eastport, which at that time contained about one
      thousand inhabitants, but <span class="pagenum">269</span><a name="link269"
      id="link269"></a>of the whole island, and issued a proclamation in which
      he declared that all the islands in the bay-had been surrendered and were
      thenceforth British territory. He gave the inhabitants one week in which
      to make their choice, either to swear allegiance to the British Crown or
      move away. About two thirds of the people took the oath, supposing they
      would thereby be admitted to the privileges of British citizenship; but a
      month later the Provincial Council of New Brunswick ordered that they
      should be treated as a conquered province and placed under martial law.
      The fortifications of Eastport were greatly strengthened, the six guns
      being increased to sixty, and a large garrison placed there. But
      provisions were extremely scarce, the men deserted in great numbers, and
      the British officers were often seen on the ramparts, doing duty as
      sentinels.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 1st of September, another British force entered Penobscot River.
      The small American garrison at Castine blew up the fort and retreated, and
      the enemy took possession, and soon issued a proclamation declaring all
      that part of Maine east of the Penobscot to be conquered territory. It
      contained about forty villages, with an aggregate of more than thirty
      thousand inhabitants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Morris, after a successful cruise, had re <span class="pagenum">270</span><a
      name="link270" id="link270"></a>cently arrived in the Penobscot with the
      American frigate <i>Adams</i>, and taken her to Hampden, thirty-five miles
      up the river, for repairs. The British commander sent up an expedition of
      about a thousand men to capture her, and Captain Morris made all possible
      preparations for defence. He erected several batteries on the shore,
      collected a small force of militia from the neighborhood, and, as they
      were unarmed, put the ship's muskets into their hands. But on the approach
      of the British regulars, the militia ran away; and Morris, seeing that he
      could not save his vessel, sent away his sailors and marines, who
      retreated across a bridge over a deep creek. He and a few men whom he had
      retained for the service then set a slow-match to the magazine, and, as
      their retreat by the bridge had been cut off, swam the stream and escaped.
      The frigate was blown to pieces, and the enemy returned to Castine with
      neither prisoners nor plunder. But they made thenceforth frequent
      incursions among the towns of the neighborhood, and freely robbed the
      inhabitants of what little property they had that was worth taking.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next orders issued to the British Commodore, Sir Thomas Hardy, were to
      destroy the town of Stonington, Connecticut; which he found a very
      different task from the capture of Moose Island. With two <span
      class="pagenum">271</span><a name="link271" id="link271"></a>frigates, a
      brig, and a bomb-vessel, he appeared before the town on the 9th of August,
      and sent in word that he should begin a bombardment in one hour. The women
      and children were hastily removed, and the men repaired to the defences of
      the place. These consisted of a small breastwork and three pieces of
      artillery&mdash;two eighteen-pounders, and a six-pounder. A rude,
      flag-staff was erected, and a small flag nailed to it. Those who had been
      trained as artillerists took their places at the guns, and the remainder,
      with muskets, were placed behind the breastwork. Word was sent to General
      Cushing, commanding at New London, and couriers on horseback rode through
      the surrounding country to rally the militia.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was toward evening when Hardy opened his ports and fired upon the town
      every kind of missile in use at that day&mdash;round-shot, grape-shot,
      canister, bomb-shells, carcasses, rockets, and stink-pots. A carcass was a
      cylindrical cage or framework of iron, covered with canvas and filled with
      combustibles, intended to set the buildings on fire. About eight o'clock,
      while the bombardment was still going on, five barges and a launch filled
      with men and carrying several guns approached the shore. The Americans
      permitted them to come within close range, and then poured such a fire of
      grape-shot <span class="pagenum">272</span><a name="link272" id="link272"></a>into
      them from the two eighteen-pounders that they were very soon compelled to
      retire. They then sailed around to the eastern side of the little
      peninsula, where they supposed it was defenceless. But the Americans
      dragged the six-pounder across, and were ready for them. With this gun
      alone, so rapidly was it served and so skilfully handled, they again drove
      off the fleet of barges.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bombardment was kept up till midnight, and next day the fleet was
      increased by the arrival of another brig. The vessels now took a position
      nearer the shore, and the action was reopened. One brig was anchored
      within pistol-shot of the battery, at which it directed its guns. But the
      old eighteen-pounders sent several balls through her between wind and
      water, compelling her to haul off and repair damages. The barges made an
      attempt to land a force, as on the day before; but met a similar reception
      and once more retired. One of the barges was completely torn to pieces by
      the fire of the six-pounder. The fleet then drifted out of reach of the
      battery, but kept up the bombardment at long range during that and the
      following day. On the 12th, Sir Thomas, who had lost twenty-one men killed
      and more than fifty wounded, bore up and sailed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the Americans, six had been slightly wounded, and one mortally. Of the
      hundred houses in Ston<span class="pagenum">273</span><a name="link273"
      id="link273"></a>ington, forty had been more or less injured, ten of them
      badly, and two or three were entirely destroyed. The enemy had thrown in
      more than sixty tons of metal. Colonel Randall, the commanding officer,
      received high praise for the manner in which he had conducted the defence,
      as did also Lieutenants Lathrop and Hough.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were smaller affairs of the same nature, at various points along the
      New England coast. At Wareham the enemy landed in safety by means of a
      flag of truce, and then burned a large cotton factory and the vessels at
      their moorings. At Scituate also they burned the shipping. But at Boothbay
      the militia rallied and drove them off with considerable loss. The attempt
      to land was repeated on several different days, but every time without
      success.

    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>ut these little
      affairs along the coast were of small consequence in comparison with what
      befell the capital of the country. Relieved by the peace in Europe, the
      English Government resolved to prosecute the American war with greater
      vigor, and fixed upon the policy of striking at the cities. Baltimore,
      Washington, Charleston, Savannah, and New Orleans were all marked for
      capture or destruction. A powerful British fleet was sent to the Bermudas,
      and a large number of veteran troops transported thither, and the
      commanders on our coasts were directed to draw thence such forces as they
      might need for their expeditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      That Washington was likely to be the object of a hostile demonstration of
      some kind, was known to the Administration for months, but no efficient
      <span class="pagenum">275</span><a name="link275" id="link275"></a>measures
      were taken to meet it. President Madison and General Armstrong, Secretary
      of War, did not like each other, and neither man was large enough not to
      let his personal feelings stand in the way of the country's interests.
      When the President urged that something should be done to avert the danger
      that threatened the capital, General Armstrong opposed the proposition
      with such abstruse reasons as that "militia were always most effective
      when first called out."
    </p>
    <p>
      The only effective means of defence consisted of a small flotilla
      commanded by Commodore Joshua Barney, who sailed the waters of Chesapeake
      Bay for some weeks, continually annoying the English fleet. On the 1st of
      June he had an engagement with two schooners in the Patuxent, and drove
      them off with hot shot. A few days later, he was chased into St. Leonard's
      Creek, where he formed his boats in line of battle across the channel and
      engaged the enemy's barges, ultimately chasing them down to the ships. On
      the 10th he was attacked by twenty barges and two schooners; but he beat
      them all off, and so severely handled one of the schooners, an
      eighteen-gun vessel, that her crew ran her aground and abandoned her. On
      the 26th, with the help of a corps of artillery and a detachment of the
      marine corps, Barney attacked the <span class="pagenum">276</span><a
      name="link276" id="link276"></a>whole squadron that was blockading him in
      the St. Leonard's, and after a fight of two hours compelled them to raise
      the blockade.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Robert Ross, who had served in several campaigns under Wellington,
      and was with Sir John Moore when he fell at Corunna, was selected by the
      Duke to command an expedition against Washington. In July, with three
      thousand five hundred men, the finest regiments of Wellington's army, he
      sailed from Bordeaux for the Chesapeake, where he arrived in August, and
      was at once reenforced by a thousand marines from Cockburn's blockading
      squadron, and a hundred negroes from the neighboring plantations, who had
      been armed and drilled as British soldiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The District of Columbia and the adjacent counties of Virginia and
      Maryland had recently been formed into a military district, of which the
      command was given to General William H. Winder. His forces consisted of
      five hundred regulars and two thousand militia. On the approach of the
      enemy, Maryland and Virginia were hastily called upon for reënforcements
      of militia, and nearly three thousand came from Maryland; but the
      Virginians, from delay in receiving their flints, did not move till the
      fighting was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ross's expedition ascended the Patuxent, and on <span class="pagenum">277</span><a
      name="link277" id="link277"></a>the morning of August 19th his troops were
      debarked without molestation at Benedict, on the western or right bank,
      forty miles southeast of Washington. He had twenty-seven vessels, and over
      four thousand men.
    </p>
    <p>
      By order of the Secretary of War, Commodore Barney blew up his little
      flotilla, and with his five hundred seamen and marines retreated to
      Nottingham, where General Winder assigned to them the management of the
      artillery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weather was fearfully hot, and the enemy proceeded by slow marches,
      dozens of men falling and fainting by the way. It was remarked at the time
      that their route might have been so impeded by felling trees, that the
      weather and the labor of removing them would have defeated the expedition.
      But nothing of the sort was done. Winder waited in a chosen position at
      Wood Yard, twelve miles from the city, to give battle. But Ross turned to
      the right after reaching Nottingham, taking the road to Marlborough, where
      Admiral Cockburn joined him with a body of marines and seamen. The
      Americans fell back to Battalion Old Fields, a detachment under Major
      Peters skirmishing sharply with the advancing enemy, and on the 24th to
      Bladensburg, six miles from Washington, where a bridge spanned the eastern
      branch of the <span class="pagenum">278</span><a name="link278"
      id="link278"></a>Potomac. Here they made a stand, taking a strong position
      on the western bank, commanding the bridge. The President and several
      members of his Cabinet were on the field, all interfering more or less
      with the military arrangements. Monroe&mdash;then Secretary of State,
      afterward President&mdash;who had been a staff officer in the Continental
      army more than thirty years before, considered himself specially qualified
      as a military meddler, and actually changed the disposition of some of
      Winder's troops at the last moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      It could not be expected that a mass of raw militia, hastily called
      together, and hardly knowing by whom they were commanded, would stand
      long, even in an advantageous position, before the onset of veteran
      troops. "Come, General Armstrong, come, Colonel Monroe," said the
      President, "let us go, and leave it to the commanding General." So Mr.
      Madison and his Cabinet left the field, and it was not long before the
      militia followed their illustrious example.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ground on the eastern side of the river, where the British approached,
      was low and clear. On the western it rose in a gradual slope, and along
      the stream was fringed with willows and larches. A body of American
      riflemen was posted in the shrubbery that lined the bank. Three hundred
      <span class="pagenum">279</span><a name="link279" id="link279"></a>yards
      up the slope was a slight earthwork, mounting six guns, supported by two
      companies of Baltimore volunteers. General Stansbury had posted three
      regiments to the right of it, but Secretary Monroe had moved them to a
      point in the rear of the battery and five hundred yards farther up the
      slope. At the top of the hill, one mile from the bridge, was formed a line
      consisting of Maryland militia on the right, Barney's seamen and marines
      in the centre, a detachment of regular troops and a regiment of District
      militia on the left, with a battery of six guns and a company of riflemen
      in front.
    </p>
    <p>
      The enemy entered the village of Bladensburg soon after noon of the 24th,
      and was at once subjected to a fire that compelled him to seek the shelter
      of the houses. At one o'clock the advance column rushed at the double
      quick upon the bridge, where it met a concentrated fire from the American
      batteries and riflemen, and almost entirely melted away. A remnant,
      however, succeeded in crossing, deployed at once, and advanced upon the
      first line, which fell back and permitted two guns to be lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elated at this success, the thin line of British troops threw off their
      knapsacks and advanced toward the second line, without waiting for another
      column to cross the bridge to their support. When <span class="pagenum">280</span><a
      name="link280" id="link280"></a>General Winder saw their error, he placed
      himself at the head of a regiment of Baltimore volunteers, gave them an
      effective volley, and then made a charge, and at the point of the bayonet
      drove them down to the very brink of the river, where with difficulty they
      maintained their foothold under the trees till another brigade had crossed
      the bridge to their relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      One regiment of these fresh troops turned the left of the American line,
      and threw in some Congreve rockets, which so frightened the militia on
      that flank that they broke at once and fled in confusion. The regiment
      headed by Winder stood firm till both its flanks were turned, when it
      retired, its retreat being covered by the riflemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The enemy then attacked the remainder of the line, all of which soon gave
      way, except Barney's men, who kept them in check for half an hour, and
      with the fire of four pieces of artillery ploughed their ranks through and
      through. But when the militia broke, the teamsters stampeded, without
      stopping to unhitch their horses from the ammunition wagons. Barney was
      thus left with but a single round of ammunition, while the enemy was
      gradually gaining a position upon his flank; and though many of his men
      were acting as infantry and behaved admirably, charging several times with
      <span class="pagenum">281</span><a name="link281" id="link281"></a>great
      effect, he was obliged to order a retreat. He himself had been severely
      wounded, while two of his principal officers were killed, and two others
      wounded. He fell into the hands of the enemy, who took him to their
      hospital at Bladensburg. In this action the Americans had lost
      seventy-seven men killed or wounded; the British, more than five hundred.
      Ross's entire loss, including deserters, prisoners, and those who
      succumbed to the weather, was said to be nearly a thousand.
    </p>
    <p>
      But no serious obstacle now stood in the way of General Ross's purpose to
      destroy the capital; and with that portion of his force which had not been
      engaged, he marched thither without the loss of an hour, arriving at eight
      o'clock that evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most valuable portion of the public archives had been removed to a
      place of safety, and Mrs. Madison had managed to carry away the original
      draft of the Declaration of Independence, a portrait of Washington that
      hung in the White House, and a few other articles which could not have
      been replaced. The magazines and shipping at the Navy Yard had already
      been fired by order of the Secretary of War, and everything there was
      destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is said that General Ross offered to spare the city for a price; but
      there was no one at hand who <span class="pagenum">282</span><a
      name="link282" id="link282"></a>could treat with him, if the authorities
      had been inclined to purchase its safety. He expected to be attacked by a
      more formidable force than that he had met at Brudensburg, and, as he
      wrote to Earl Bathurst, "judging it of consequence to complete the
      destruction of the public buildings with the least possible delay, so that
      the army might retire without loss of time, he without a moment's delay
      burned and destroyed everything in the most distant degree connected with
      the government." There was one notable exception. At the intercession of
      Dr. Thornton, who superintended the Patent Office, the building containing
      that and the Post Office was spared; because, as the doctor represented,
      it contained great numbers of models and papers which were of value to the
      whole scientific world. The jail, one hotel, and a few dwellings also
      escaped. All else, including the President's house, the public libraries,
      and the new Capitol&mdash;of which only the wings had been built&mdash;was
      given to the flames. The commanders of the expedition distinguished
      themselves personally in this vandalism. Admiral Cochrane, who had a spite
      against the <i>National Intelligencer</i> because of its strictures upon
      his marauding exploits along the coast, caused the office to be sacked and
      the type thrown into, the street, and with his own hand set <span
      class="pagenum">283</span><a name="link283" id="link283"></a>the building
      on fire. Admiral Cockburn is said to have led his men into the hall of the
      House of Representatives, where he leaped into the Speaker's chair and
      shouted, "Shall this harbor of Yankee democracy be burned? All for it will
      say, Aye!"
    </p>
    <p>
      In the night of the 25th, Ross silently withdrew from the city, leaving
      his camp-fires burning, for he expected and feared pursuit-, and marched
      with all that remained of his force to Benedict, where they reëmbarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      A division of the enemy's fleet, consisting of eight vessels, ascended the
      Potomac to attack the city of Alexandria. Fort Warburton, a small work
      intended for its defence, was destroyed by the garrison at the approach of
      the ships, and with no opposition they passed up and laid the town under
      their guns. A parley was had, the result of which was that the dwellings
      were left unmolested, the condition being, "the immediate delivery [to the
      enemy] of all public and private naval and ordnance stores; of all
      shipping, and the furniture necessary to their equipment then in port; of
      all the merchandise of every description, whether in the town or removed
      from it since the 19th of the month; that such merchandise should be put
      on board the shipping at the expense of the owners; and that all vessels
      which might have been sunk upon the approach of <span class="pagenum">284</span><a
      name="link284" id="link284"></a>the fleet should be raised by the
      merchants and delivered up with all their apparatus." These conditions,
      hard as they were, were complied with, and on the 6th of September the
      fleet, loaded with booty, returned down the river. Two batteries on the
      shore&mdash;at White House and Indian Head, commanded by Captains Porter
      and Perry, of the navy&mdash;damaged it considerably as it passed, but
      were not able to stop it.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the importance of General Ross's exploit was overrated by the
      Americans, who naturally felt chagrined that so small an invading force
      should have destroyed their capital and momentarily dispersed their
      Government, it was enormously exaggerated by the English journals. By
      confounding the capital of the country with its metropolis, they led their
      readers to believe that the chief city of the United States had been laid
      in ashes; whereas Washington was but a straggling place of eight thousand
      inhabitants, which had been made the seat of the Federal Government but a
      dozen years before. Taking it for granted that what would have befallen
      England or France with London or Paris in the possession of a foreign
      enemy, had actually befallen the United States, the London <i>Times</i>
      proceeded to say: "The ill-organized association is on the eve of
      dissolution, and the world is speed<span class="pagenum">285</span><a
      name="link285" id="link285"></a>ily to be delivered of the mischievous
      example of the existence of a government founded on democratic rebellion."
      In another issue, October 9th, 1814, it said: "Next to the annihilation of
      the late military despotism in Europe, the subversion of that system of
      fraud and malignity which constitutes the whole policy of the Jeffersonian
      school, was an event to be devoutly wished by every man in either
      hemisphere who regards rational liberty or the honorable intercourse of
      nations. It was an event to which we should have bent, and yet must bend,
      all our energies. The American Government must be displaced, or it will
      sooner or later plant its poisoned dagger in the heart of the parent
      state." In a speech in Parliament, Sir Gilbert Heathcote naively said, "it
      appeared to him that we feared the rising power of America, and wished to
      curtail it." Which, as the Scottish captain in the story said, was "a
      verra just remark."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the night of August 30th, Sir Peter Parker, commander of the frigate <i>Menelaus</i>,
      who had been blockading Baltimore with that and another vessel, landed on
      the Eastern Shore, with two hundred and thirty men, intending to surprise
      and capture a small body of Maryland volunteers at Moorfields. But the
      Maryland men were ready for them, and after a sharp fight of about an hour
      the British re<span class="pagenum">286</span><a name="link286"
      id="link286"></a>treated, leaving sixteen of their men killed or wounded
      on the field, and bearing away seventeen others, among whom was Sir Peter,
      who died almost as soon as he reached his ship. Three of the Americans
      were wounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rightly conjecturing that Baltimore would be the next place at which the
      enemy would strike, the people of that city had made haste to provide for
      its defence. The fortifications were extended, and manned by about five
      thousand men. On the 11th of September, forty British war-vessels appeared
      at the mouth of the Patapsco, and that night eight thousand men, under
      General Ross, were landed at North Point, a dozen miles below the city. No
      resistance was offered till they had marched four miles up the little
      peninsula, when they were met by General John Strivker with three thousand
      two hundred men, including an artillery company with six small guns, and a
      detachment of cavalry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cavalry and a hundred and fifty riflemen were thrown forward to feel
      the enemy. General Ross, who had declared that he "did n't care if it
      rained militia," and had expressed his intention of making winter quarters
      in Baltimore, put himself at the head of his advance guard, and promptly
      attacked. But as he rode along the crest of a little knoll, he was shot in
      the side by an American rifle<span class="pagenum">287</span><a
      name="link287" id="link287"></a>man, and before his aides could bear him
      back to the boats, he expired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the loss of their leader, the British forces rushed
      steadily forward, drove the American skirmishers back upon the main line,
      and brought on a general engagement. The battle lasted two or three hours
      with varying fortune, till a heavy attack on the American left turned it,
      when the whole body retreated to an intrenched position near the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      The British followed the next day, but found their enemy strongly placed
      and reenforced, whereupon they took advantage of a dark night and retraced
      their steps. They had lost two hundred and ninety men, killed or wounded,
      and had inflicted upon the Americans a loss of two hundred and thirteen,
      including fifty prisoners. This action is known as the battle of North
      Point, but has sometimes been called the battle of Long-log Lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Ross's men were approaching Baltimore by land, sixteen vessels of
      the British fleet moved up the bay, and opened fire upon its immediate
      defences. The shallowness of the water prevented them from getting near
      enough to bombard the town itself; but for twenty-four hours they poured
      an almost uninterrupted shower of rockets and shells into Fort McHenry,
      Fort Covington, and the <span class="pagenum">288</span><a name="link288"
      id="link288"></a>connecting intrenchments. Most of the firing was at long
      range; whenever any of the vessels came within reach of the batteries,
      they were subjected to a fire that quickly drove them back, and in some
      cases sank them. Fort McHenry, garrisoned by six hundred men under Major
      George Armistead, bore the brunt of the attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the dead of night the enemy attempted to land a strong force above the
      forts, for an attack in the rear; but it was discovered and subjected to a
      concentrated fire of red-hot shot, which speedily drove it off with
      serious loss. This practically put an end to the attempt to take
      Baltimore, and a few hours later the fleet withdrew. The loss of the
      Americans by the bombardment was four killed and twenty-four wounded. The
      loss in the fleet is unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      This bombardment of Fort McHenry gave us one of our national songs.
      Francis S. Key had gone out to the British fleet in a row-boat, under a
      flag of truce, to ask for the release on parole of a friend who had been
      made prisoner. Admiral Cockburn, who had just completed his plans for the
      attack, detained him, and in his little boat, moored to the side of the
      flag-ship, he sat and watched the bombardment. When the second morning
      broke, and he saw that the flag of the fort&mdash;which Cockburn <span
      class="pagenum">289</span><a name="link289" id="link289"></a>had boasted
      would "yield in a few hours"&mdash;was still flying, he took an old letter
      out of his pocket, and on the back of it wrote the first draft of "The
      Star-Spangled Banner." The flag is now in the possession of the
      Massachusetts Historical Society.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he naval contests
      of 1814 and the winter of 1815 repeated and emphasized the lesson of the
      first year of the war; they were all, with but two exceptions, American
      victories.
    </p>
    <p>
      The remarkable cruise of the <i>Essex</i>, commanded by Captain David
      Porter, begun late in 1812, extended along the coast of South America,
      around Cape Horn, and throughout almost the entire eastern half of the
      Pacific, ending in a bloody battle in the harbor of Valparaiso, in March,
      1814. The prizes taken in the Atlantic were of little value, except one.
      The packet ship <i>Nocton</i>, captured just south of the equator, had
      $55,000 in specie, on board, with which Porter subsequently paid off his
      men. She was put in charge of a prize crew, and <span class="pagenum">291</span><a
      name="link291" id="link291"></a>sailed for the United States, but was
      recaptured on the way by a British frigate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Porter had sailed under orders to meet Commodore Bainbridge, who had gone
      to sea with the <i>Constitution</i> and the <i>Hornet</i>. But after
      failing to find either of those vessels at three successive rendezvous, he
      determined to carry out a plan which he had submitted to the Secretary of
      the Navy some time before, for a cruise against the British whalers in the
      Pacific. After the usual stormy passage, he doubled Cape Horn in February,
      1813. His description of one of the gales shows us that the greatest
      dangers undergone by a man-of-war are not always from the guns of the
      enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was with no little joy we now saw ourselves fairly in the Pacific
      Ocean, calculating on a speedy end to all our sufferings. We began also to
      form our projects for annoying the enemy, and had already equipped, in
      imagination, one of their vessels of fourteen or sixteen guns, and manned
      her from the <i>Essex</i>, to cruise against their commerce. Indeed,
      various were the schemes we formed at this time, and had in fancy immense
      wealth to return with to our country. But the wind freshened up to a gale,
      and by noon had reduced us to our storm stay-sail and close-reefed
      main-top-sail. In the afternoon it hauled around to the westward, and blew
      <span class="pagenum">292</span><a name="link292" id="link292"></a>with a
      fury far exceeding anything we had yet experienced, bringing with it such
      a tremendous sea as to threaten us every moment with destruction, and
      appalled the stoutest heart on board. Our sails, our standing and running
      rigging, from the succession of bad weather, had become so damaged as to
      be no longer trustworthy; we took, however, the best means in our power to
      render everything secure, and carried as heavy a press of sail as the ship
      would bear, to keep her from drifting on the coast of Patagonia, which we
      had reason to believe was not far distant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "From the excessive violence with which the wind blew, we had strong hopes
      that it would be of short continuance; until, worn out with fatigue and
      anxiety, greatly alarmed with the terrors of a lee shore, and in momentary
      expectation of the loss of our masts and bowsprit, we almost considered
      our situation hopeless. To add to our distress, our pumps had become
      choked by the shingle ballast, which, from the violent rolling of the
      ship, had got into them, and the sea had increased to such a height as to
      threaten to swallow us at every instant. The whole ocean was one continual
      foam of breakers, and the heaviest squall that I ever experienced had not
      equalled in violence the most moderate intervals of this tremendous
      hurricane. We had, however, done <span class="pagenum">293</span><a
      name="link293" id="link293"></a>all that lay in our power to preserve the
      ship, and turned our attention to our pumps, which we were enabled to
      clear, and to keep the ship from drifting on shore, by getting on the most
      advantageous tack. We were enabled to wear but once; for the violence of
      the wind and sea was such as afterward to render it impossible to attempt
      it, without hazarding the destruction of the ship and the loss of every
      life on board. Our fatigue had been constant and excessive; many had been
      severely bruised by being thrown, by the violent jerks of the ship, down
      the hatchways, and I was particularly unfortunate in receiving three
      severe falls, which at length disabled me from going on deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We had shipped several heavy seas, that would have proved destructive to
      almost any other ship. About three o'clock of the morning of the 3d, the
      watch only being on deck, an enormous sea broke over the ship, and for an
      instant destroyed every hope. Our gun-deck ports were burst in, both boats
      on the quarter stove, our spare spars washed from the chains, our
      head-rails washed away, and hammock stanchions burst in, and the ship
      perfectly deluged and water-logged. Immediately after this tremendous
      shock, which threw the crew into consternation, the gale began to abate,
      and in the morning we were enabled to set our reefed foresail. <span
      class="pagenum">294</span><a name="link294" id="link294"></a>In the height
      of the gale, Lewis Price, a marine, who had long been confined with a
      pulmonary complaint, departed this life, and was in the morning committed
      to the deep; but the violence of the sea was such that the crew could not
      be permitted to come on deck to attend the ceremony of his burial, as
      their weight would have strained and endangered the safety of the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When this last sea broke on board us, one of the prisoners exclaimed that
      the ship's broadside was stove in, and that she was sinking. This alarm
      was greatly calculated to increase the fears of those below, who, from the
      immense torrent of water that was rushing down the hatchways, had reason
      to believe the truth of his assertion. Many who were washed from the spar-
      to the gun-deck, and from their hammocks, and did not know the extent of
      the injury, were also greatly alarmed; but the men at the wheel, and some
      others, who were enabled by a good grasp to keep their stations,
      distinguished themselves by their coolness and activity after the shock."
    </p>
    <p>
      Porter touched at the island of Mocha, and afterward ran into the harbor
      of Valparaiso, where he learned that his arrival in the Pacific was most
      opportune; for there were many American whalers that had left home before
      the war began, and knew <span class="pagenum">295</span><a name="link295"
      id="link295"></a>nothing of it, while some English whalers, sailing later,
      had taken out letters of marque, and carried guns, and were making prizes
      of the unsuspecting Americans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Porter soon captured a Peruvian privateer, and two English whalers, and
      recaptured an American ship that had been taken by the enemy. One of the
      whalers carried six guns, and the other ten. He placed the entire armament
      in the faster sailer, cut away her try-works, and with some other
      alterations converted her into a war-vessel, giving the command of her to
      John Downes, his first lieutenant. Subsequently a still better ship for
      the purpose was captured, and the armament was shifted to that, which was
      then re-christened <i>Essex Junior</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      With these two ships Porter scoured the ocean for the next six months, and
      took numerous prizes, nearly all English whalers, several of which had
      armed themselves as privateers. One he loaded with oil and sent home. Two
      or three, as he could spare no more men for prize crews, he disarmed and
      allowed to go home in charge of their own crews, carrying also the other
      prisoners, all of whom were paroled. One captain, whom he found cruising
      as a privateer without a commission as such, he put in irons, to be tried
      as a pirate when the <i>Essex</i> should return home. In that six months,
      Porter and <span class="pagenum">296</span><a name="link296" id="link296"></a>Downes
      had captured four thousand tons of British shipping, taking four hundred
      prisoners; and as they could now hear of no more in that part of the
      Pacific, they went in October to the Marquesas Islands, to refit their
      vessels and let the crews have a rest and a run on shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      There in the beautiful harbor of Nukahiva they made repairs and wooded and
      watered at their leisure. Porter formally took possession of the island in
      the name of the United States, called it Madison's Island, and the harbor
      Massachusetts Bay, and built a fort on the shore, in which he mounted four
      guns. Near the fort he constructed a small village, consisting of six
      houses, a rope-walk, a bakery, and other buildings, which he named
      Madisonville.
    </p>
    <p>
      His "Journal" gives an interesting account of their life for four or five
      weeks among the natives of that romantic and then almost unknown group.
      One of the most exciting incidents of it was a war between two tribes&mdash;the
      Happahs and the Typees&mdash;occupying different parts of the island. All
      the tribes of the island except the Typees had made a sort of treaty of
      friendship and alliance with Porter. As he and his men were guests of the
      Happahs, and the Typees had begun to treat them as enemies, Porter felt
      obliged to join in the war, when the superiority of the fire-arms over the
      native <span class="pagenum">297</span><a name="link297" id="link297"></a>weapons
      ended it in the disastrous defeat of the Typees. But this was not
      accomplished without severe fighting, in which the Typees exhibited the
      most determined courage, and a great degree of military skill, making the
      best of such weapons and advantages as they had. Porter's campaign in the
      Typee valley is one of the most singular episodes in all the annals of
      war, and the reader will probably be interested in some passages from his
      account of it, though it has no necessary connection with the subject to
      which this volume is devoted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We arrived at the Typee landing at sunrise, and were joined by ten
      war-canoes from the Happahs. The <i>Essex Junior</i> soon after arrived
      and anchored. The tops of all the neighboring mountains were covered with
      the Taeeh and Happah warriors, armed with their spears, clubs, and slings.
      The beach was covered with the warriors who came with the canoes, and who
      joined us from the hills. Our force did not amount to a less number than
      five thousand men; but not a Typee or any of their dwellings were to be
      seen. For the whole length of the beach, extending upward of a quarter of
      a mile, was a clear level plain which extended back about one hundred
      yards. A high and almost impenetrable swampy thicket bordered on this
      plain, and <span class="pagenum">298</span><a name="link298" id="link298"></a>the
      only trace we could perceive which, we were informed, led to the
      habitations, was a narrow pathway which winded through the swamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The canoes were all hauled on the beach, the Taeehs on the right, the
      Happahs on the left, and our four boats in the centre. We only waited for
      reënforcements from the Essex Junior, our interpreter, our ambassadors,
      and Gattanewa [chief of the Happahs], I went on board to hasten them on
      shore, and on my return to the beach I found everyone in arms. The Typees
      had appeared in the bushes, and had pelted our people with stones while
      they were quietly eating their breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had a man with me who had intermarried with the Typees, and was
      privileged to go among them, and I furnished him with a white flag and
      sent him to tell them I had come to offer peace, but was prepared for war.
      In a few minutes he came running back, and informed me he had met in the
      bushes an ambuscade of Typees, who had threatened to put him to death if
      he again ventured among them. In an instant afterward a shower of stones
      came from the bushes, and at the same moment one of the Typees darted
      across the pathway and was shot through the leg, but was carried off by
      his friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lieutenant Downes arrived with his men, and I <span class="pagenum">299</span><a
      name="link299" id="link299"></a>gave the order to march. We entered the
      bushes, and were at every instant assailed by spears and stones, which
      came from different parts of the enemy in ambuscade. We could hear the
      snapping of the slings, the whistling of the stones; the spears came
      quivering by us, but we could not perceive from whom they came. No enemy
      was to be seen, not a whisper was to be heard among them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We had advanced about a mile, and came to a small opening on the bank of
      a river, from the thicket on the opposite side of which we were assailed
      with a shower of stones, when Lieutenant Downes received a blow which
      shattered the bone of his left leg, and he fell. The allied tribes sat as
      silent observers of our operations; the sides of the mountains were still
      covered with them, and I as well as the Taeehs had no slight grounds to
      doubt the fidelity of the Happahs. A defeat would have sealed our
      destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Indians began to leave us, and all depended on our own exertions. I
      directed Mr. Shaw with four men to escort Lieutenant Downes to the beach,
      which reduced the number of my men to twenty-four. We soon came to a place
      for fording the river, in the thick bushes of the opposite bank of which
      the Typees made a bold stand. We endeavored in vain to clear the bushes
      with our musketry. <span class="pagenum">300</span><a name="link300"
      id="link300"></a>The stones and spears flew with augmented numbers. I
      directed a volley to be fired, three cheers to be given, and to dash
      across the river. We soon gained the opposite bank, and continued our
      march, rendered still more difficult by the underwood, which was here so
      interlaced as to make it necessary sometimes to crawl on our hands and
      knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On emerging from the swamp, we perceived a strong and extensive wall of
      seven feet in height, raised on an eminence crossing our road, and flanked
      on each side by an impenetrable thicket. In an instant afterward we were
      assailed by such a shower of stones, accompanied by the most horrid yells,
      as left no doubt that we had here to encounter their principal strength. A
      tree which afforded shelter from their stones enabled me, accompanied by
      Lieutenant Gamble, to annoy them as they rose above the wall to throw at
      us; but these were the only muskets that could be employed to advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Finding we could not dislodge them, I gave orders for taking the place by
      storm. But some of my men had expended all their cartridges, few had more
      than three or four remaining, and our only safety depended on holding our
      ground till we could procure a fresh supply. I despatched Lieutenant
      Gamble and four men to the <i>Essex Junior</i>, and from the time of their
      departure we were chiefly occupied <span class="pagenum">301</span><a
      name="link301" id="link301"></a>in eluding the stones, which came with
      redoubled force and numbers. Three of my men were knocked down by them. As
      a feint, we retreated a few paces, and in an instant the Indians rushed on
      us with hideous yells. The first and second that advanced were killed at
      the distance of a few paces, and those who attempted to carry them off
      were wounded. They abandoned their dead, and precipitately retreated to
      their fort. Taking advantage of the terror they were thrown into, we
      marched off with our wounded, returning to the beach much fatigued and
      with no contemptible opinion of the enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The next day I determined to proceed with a force which I believed they
      could not resist, and selected two hundred men from the <i>Essex</i>, the
      <i>Essex Junior</i>, and the prizes. As some of the boats were leaky, I
      determined to go by land, over the mountain ridge. We had a fine,
      moonlight night, and I hoped to be down in the Typee valley long before
      daylight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a whisper was heard from one end of the line to the other. Our guides
      marched in front, and we followed in silence up and down the steep sides
      of rocks and mountains, through rivulets, thickets, and reed-brakes, and
      by the sides of precipices which sometimes caused us to shudder. At twelve
      o'clock we could hear the drums beating in <span class="pagenum">302</span><a
      name="link302" id="link302"></a>the Typee valley, accompanied by loud
      singing, and the number of lights in different parts of it induced me to
      believe they were rejoicing. I inquired the cause, and was informed by the
      Indians that they were celebrating the victory they had obtained over us,
      and calling on their gods to give them rain in order that it might render
      our bouhier [muskets] useless.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Indians told us it would be impossible to descend without daylight;
      and when it was light enough to see down the valley, we were surprised at
      the height and steepness. A narrow pathway pointed out the track, but it
      was soon lost among the cliffs. Before I left the hill, I determined by
      firing a volley to show the natives that our muskets had not received as
      much injury as they had expected from the rain. As soon as they heard the
      report, and discovered our number, which, with the multitude of Indians of
      both tribes who had now assembled, was very numerous, they shouted, beat
      their drums, and blew their war-conchs from one end of the valley to the
      other; and what with the squealing of the hogs, which they now began to
      catch, the screaming of the women and children, and the yelling of the
      men, the din was horrible.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We descended with great difficulty into the village of the Happahs, where
      everything bore the ap<span class="pagenum">303</span><a name="link303"
      id="link303"></a>pearance of a hostile disposition on their part. I sent
      for their chief, and required to know if they were hostilely disposed. I
      told him it was necessary we should have something to eat, and that I
      expected his people to bring us hogs and fruit, and if they did not do so,
      I should be under the necessity of sending out parties to shoot the hogs
      and cut down their fruit-trees, as our people were too fatigued to climb
      them. I also directed that they should lay by their spears and clubs. No
      notice being taken of these demands, I caused many of their spears and
      clubs to be taken from them and broken, and sent parties out to shoot
      hogs, while others were employed in cutting down cocoanut and banana trees
      until we had a sufficient supply. The chiefs and people now became
      intimidated, and brought baked hogs in greater abundance than was
      required.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At daylight next morning the line of march was formed. On ascending the
      ridge where we had passed such a disagreeable night, we halted to take
      breath, and view for a few minutes the delightful valley which was soon to
      become a scene of desolation. We had a distant view of every part. The
      valley was about nine miles in length, and three or four in breadth,
      surrounded on every part, except the beach, by lofty mountains. The upper
      part <span class="pagenum">304</span><a name="link304" id="link304"></a>was
      bounded by a precipice many hundred feet in height, from the top of which
      a handsome sheet of water was precipitated, and formed a beautiful river
      which ran meandering through the valley. Villages were scattered here and
      there; the bread-fruit and cocoanut trees flourished luxuriantly and in
      abundance; plantations laid out in good order, enclosed with stone walls,
      were in a high state of cultivation; and everything bespoke industry,
      abundance, and happiness. Never in my life did I witness a more delightful
      scene or experience more repugnance than I now felt for the necessity
      which compelled me to punish a happy and heroic people.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A large assembly of Typee warriors were posted on the opposite banks of
      the river, and dared us to descend. In their rear was a fortified village,
      secured by strong stone walls. Drums were beating and war-conchs sounding,
      and we soon found they were making every effort to oppose us.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As soon as we reached the foot of the mountain we were annoyed by a
      shower of stones from the bushes and from behind stone walls. After
      resting a few minutes, I directed the scouting parties to gain the
      opposite bank of the river, and followed with the main body. The fortified
      village was taken without loss on our side; but their chief warrior and
      another were killed, and several wounded. They <span class="pagenum">305</span><a
      name="link305" id="link305"></a>retreated only to stone walls on higher
      ground, where they continued to sling their stones and throw their spears.
      Three of my men were wounded, and many of the Typees killed, before we
      dislodged them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Parties were sent out to scour the woods, and another fort was taken
      after some resistance; but the party, overpowered by numbers, were
      compelled to retreat to the main body, after keeping possession of it half
      an hour. We were waiting, in the fort first taken, for the return of our
      scouting parties. A multitude of Tayees and Happahs were with us, and many
      were on the outskirts of the village, seeking for plunder. Lieutenant
      McKnight had driven a party from a strong wall on the high ground, and had
      possession of it, when a large party of Typees, who had been lying in
      ambush, rushed by his fire and darted into the fort with their spears. The
      Tayeehs and Happahs all ran. The Typees approached within pistol-shot, but
      on the first fire retreated precipitately, crossing the fire of McKnight's
      party, and although none fell, we had reason to believe that many were
      wounded. The spears and stones were flying from the bushes in every
      direction; and although we killed and wounded in this place great numbers
      of them, we were satisfied that we should have to fight our way through
      the whole valley. <span class="pagenum">306</span><a name="link306"
      id="link306"></a>"I sent a messenger to inform the Typees that we should
      cease hostilities when they no longer made resistance, but so long as
      stones were thrown I should destroy their villages. No notice was taken of
      this message.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We continued our march up the valley, and met in our way several
      beautiful villages, which we set on fire, and at length arrived at their
      capital&mdash;for it deserves the name of one. We had been compelled to
      fight every inch of ground, and here they made considerable opposition.
      The place was soon carried, however, and I very reluctantly set fire to
      it. The beauty and regularity of this place were such as to strike every
      spectator with astonishment. Their public square was far superior to any
      other we had met with. Numbers of their gods were here destroyed; several
      large and elegant new war-canoes were burned in the houses that sheltered
      them, and many of their drums were thrown into the flames. Our Indians
      loaded themselves with plunder, after destroying bread-fruit and other
      trees and all the young plants they could find. We had now arrived at the
      upper end of the valley, about nine miles from the beach, and at the foot
      of the waterfall above mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "After resting about half an hour, I directed the Indians to take care of
      our wounded, and we formed <span class="pagenum">307</span><a
      name="link307" id="link307"></a>the line of march and proceeded down the
      valley, in our route destroying several other villages, at all of which we
      had some skirmishing. At one of these places, at the foot of a steep hill,
      the enemy rolled down enormous stones, with a view of crushing us to
      death. The number of villages destroyed amounted to ten; and the
      destruction of trees and plants, and the plunder carried off by the
      Indians, was almost incredible. The Typees fought us to the last, and even
      at first harassed our rear on our return; but parties left in ambush soon
      put a stop to further annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We at length came to the formidable fort which checked our career on our
      first day's enterprise, and although I had witnessed many instances of the
      great exertion and ingenuity of these islanders, I never had supposed them
      capable of contriving and erecting a work like this. It formed the segment
      of a circle, and was about fifty yards in extent, built of large stones,
      six feet thick at the bottom and gradually narrowing to the top. On the
      left was a narrow entrance, merely sufficient to admit one person's
      entering. The wings and rear were equally guarded, and the right was
      flanked by another fortification of greater magnitude and equal strength
      and ingenuity. I directed the Indians and my own men to put their
      shoulders to the wall and endeavor <span class="pagenum">308</span><a
      name="link308" id="link308"></a>to throw it down; but no impression could
      be made upon it. It appeared of ancient date, and time alone can destroy
      it. We succeeded in making a small breach, through which we passed on our
      route to the beach,&mdash;a route which was familiar to us, but had now
      become doubly intricate from the number of trees which had since been cut
      down and placed across the pathway.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The chiefs of the Happahs invited me to return to their valley, assuring
      me that an abundance of everything was already provided for us; and the
      girls, who had assembled in great numbers, dressed out in their best
      attire, welcomed me with smiles. Gattanewa met me on the side of the hill
      as I was ascending. The old man's heart was full; he could not speak; he
      placed both my hands on his head, rested his forehead on my knees, and
      after a short pause, raising himself, placed his hands on my breast, and
      exclaimed <i>Gattanewa!</i> and then on his own and said <i>Apotee!</i>
      [Porter] to remind me we had exchanged names.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When I reached the summit of the mountain, I stopped to contemplate that
      valley which in the morning we had viewed in all its beauty. A long line
      of smoking ruins now marked our traces from one end to the other, the
      opposite hills were covered with the unhappy fugitives, and the whole
      presented <span class="pagenum">309</span><a name="link309" id="link309"></a>a
      scene of desolation and horror. Unhappy and heroic people! the victims of
      your own courage and mistaken pride. While the instruments of your fate
      shed the tear of pity over your misfortunes, thousands of your countrymen&mdash;nay,
      brethren of the same family&mdash;triumphed in your distresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The day of our return was devoted to rest. But a messenger was despatched
      to the Typees to inform them I was still willing to make peace, and that I
      should not allow them to return to their valley until they had come on
      terms of friendship with us, and exchanged presents. They readily
      consented to the terms, and requested to know the number of hogs I should
      require. I told them I should expect from them four hundred, which they
      assured me should be delivered without delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Flags were now sent from all the other tribes, with large presents of
      hogs and fruit, and peace was established throughout the island. The
      chiefs, the priests, and the principal persons of the tribes were very
      solicitous of forming a relationship with me by an exchange of names with
      some of my family. Some wished to bear the name of my brother, my
      son-in-law, my brother-in-law, etc., and when all the male stock were
      exhausted, they as anxiously solicited the names of the other sex. The
      name of my son, however, was more desired than any other, <span
      class="pagenum">310</span><a name="link310" id="link310"></a>and many old
      men, whose long gray beards rendered their appearance venerable, were
      known by the name of <i>Pickaneenee Apotee</i>; the word 'pickaninny'
      having been introduced among them by the sailors."
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Porter was undoubtedly sincere in the belief that what he had done
      was a necessity of war. But when we consider that it arose simply from the
      refusal of a people, standing on their own ground, to enter into a treaty
      of amity with strangers whose language they could not speak, and whose
      purposes they did not understand, it looks as if the captain had imposed a
      pretty heavy penalty for a small offence, and given the unfortunate Typees
      as unfair treatment as he himself experienced a few months later in the
      harbor of Valparaiso.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Captain Porter had learned that an English frigate had been
      sent out to stop his career; and as whalers had now become scarce, and he
      had taken as many prizes as he could well manage, after refitting at the
      Marquesas Islands, he sailed in search of his enemy. The truth was,
      Captain James Hillyar, of the British navy, was looking for him with <i>two</i>
      ships, the <i>Phoebe</i> and the <i>Cherub</i>, mounting respectively
      fifty-three and twenty-eight guns; and there is good reason to believe
      that the Admiralty had sent him out with stringent orders to find and
      <span class="pagenum">311</span><a name="link311" id="link311"></a>destroy
      or capture the <i>Essex</i> at all hazards. He found her at Valparaiso,
      and blockaded her there for six weeks. On one occasion the <i>Essex</i>
      and the <i>Phoebe</i> almost fouled, through the fault of the latter, and
      Porter called away his boarders and in a moment more would have been on
      the Englishman's deck; but Hillyar protested so earnestly that he had no
      intention of attacking in a neutral port, that he was permitted to
      withdraw from his suspicious position. Had Porter been more shrewd and
      less chivalrous, he would perhaps have seen that there was no way to
      account for the position of the <i>Phoebe</i>, except on the supposition
      that Hillyar was intending to carry the <i>Essex</i> by boarding, had he
      not found her commander and crew too ready for him. That he cared nothing
      for the neutrality of the port, was demonstrated by his subsequent
      conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      After vainly offering battle on equal terms, Porter, on the 28th of March,
      attempted to put to sea. But his ship was struck by a heavy squall, which
      carried away the main-top-mast. Being pursued by the <i>Phoebe</i> and <i>Cherub</i>,
      he tacked about, reentered the harbor, and anchored within pistol-shot of
      the shore. Paying not the slightest regard to the neutrality of the port,
      the enemy followed the <i>Essex</i>, took a position under her stern, and
      opened fire. Even under this disadvantage, Porter got three long <span
      class="pagenum">312</span><a name="link312" id="link312"></a>guns out at
      the stern ports, and fought them so skilfully that in half an hour both
      the <i>Phoebe</i> and the <i>Cherub</i> drew off for repairs. They next
      took a position on the starboard quarter, out of reach of the carronades
      that composed the Essex's broadside, and fired at her with their long
      guns. Under his flying jib, the only sail he could set, Porter ran down
      upon the enemy, and after a short and intense action at close range, drove
      off the <i>Cherub</i>. But the <i>Phoebe</i> edged away again out of reach
      of his carronades, and kept up a steady fire from her long guns. The
      slaughter on board the <i>Essex</i> was sickening. At one gun, three whole
      crews were swept away in succession. Says Captain Porter, in his
      'Journal', "I was informed that the cockpit, the steerage, the ward-room,
      and the berth-deck could contain no more wounded; that the wounded were
      killed while the surgeons were dressing them; and that, unless something
      was speedily done to prevent it, the ship would soon sink from the number
      of shot-holes in her bottom."
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain next tried to run her ashore; but while she was still nearly a
      mile from the land, the wind suddenly shifted. A hawser was bent to the
      sheet anchor, and the ship swung round so as to bring her broadside to
      bear on the enemy, but the hawser soon parted. Indeed, she had anchored in
      <span class="pagenum">313</span><a name="link313" id="link313"></a>the
      first place with springs on her cables, but the springs had been
      repeatedly shot away. *
    </p>
    <p>
      With all these misfortunes, the ship took fire, and as the flames burst up
      the hatchways Porter ordered all who could swim to jump overboard and
      strike out for the shore, as the boats had been destroyed by the enemy's
      shot. The flames were extinguished; but the Essex was now a wreck,
      deliberately raked by every discharge from her antagonist, and the colors
      were struck. The <i>Essex Junior</i> had been in no condition to assist in
      the fight, but was included in the surrender. Out of two hundred and
      fifty-five men, Porter had lost one hundred and fifty-four in killed,
      wounded, or missing. Hillyar reported the loss on his two ships as five
      killed and ten wounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The battle had been witnessed by thousands of people on shore. So near
      were the vessels to land a part of the time, that many of the <i>Phoebe's</i>
      shot struck the beach. The United States Consul, Joel R. Poinsett,
      protested to the Chilian authorities
    </p>
    <p>
      * A "spring" of this sort is a rope, one end of which is attached to the
      cable and the other end carried to the after part of the ship, so that by
      hauling upon it she can be swung round to point her broadside in any
      desired direction. A high authority&mdash;Farragut&mdash;says one of
      Porter's serious mistakes in this action was in fastening the springs to
      the cable, when they should have been fastened to the anchor, which would
      have carried the greater part of them below the surface of the water, out
      of the reach of shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">314</span><a name="link314" id="link314"></a>against
      the violation of neutrality, and demanded that the batteries protect the
      <i>Essex</i>; but he received no satisfactory answer, and took the first
      opportunity of leaving the country. Captain Porter estimated that it had
      cost the British Government nearly six million dollars to possess his
      ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the crew of the <i>Essex</i> was a midshipman twelve years old, who
      subsequently became the greatest of all naval commanders, David G.
      Farragut.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his "Journal" he describes vividly the battle and the part he took in
      it. Some passages will be of interest here, as they present pictures
      seldom found in the descriptions of such contests:
    </p>

      "I well remember the feelings of awe produced in me by the approach of the
      hostile ships; even to my young mind it was perceptible in the faces of
      those around me, as clearly as possible, that our case was hopeless. It
      was equally apparent that all were ready to die at their guns, rather than
      surrender; and such I believe to have been the determination of the crew,
      almost to a man. There had been so much bantering of each other between
      the men of the ships, through the medium of letters and songs, with an
      invariable fight between the boats' crews when they met on shore, that a
      very hostile sentiment was engendered. Our flags were flying from every
      mast, and the enemy's vessels displayed <span class="pagenum">315</span><a
      name="link315" id="link315"></a>their ensigns, jacks, and motto-flags, as
      they bore down grandly to the attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I performed the duties of captain's aid, quarter-gunner, powder-boy, and
      in fact did everything that was required of me. I shall never forget the
      horrid impression made upon me by the sight of the first man I had ever
      seen killed. He was a boatswain's mate, and was fearfully mutilated. It
      staggered and sickened me at first; but they soon began to fall around me
      so fast that it all appeared like a dream, and produced no effect on my
      nerves. I can remember well, while I was standing near the captain, just
      abaft the mainmast, a shot came through the water-ways and glanced upward,
      killing four men who were standing by the side of the gun, taking the last
      one in the head and scattering his brains over both of us. But this awful
      sight did not affect me half as much as the death of the first poor
      fellow. I neither thought of nor noticed anything but the working of the
      guns.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On one occasion Midshipman Isaacs came up to the captain and reported
      that a quarter-gunner named Roach had deserted his post. The only reply of
      the captain, addressed to me, was, 'Do your duty, sir.' I seized a pistol
      and went in pursuit of the fellow, but did not find him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Soon after this, some gun-primers were wanted. <span class="pagenum">316</span><a
      name="link316" id="link316"></a>and I was sent after them. In going below,
      while I was on the ward-room ladder, the captain of the gun directly
      opposite the hatchway was struck full in the face by an eighteen-pound
      shot, and fell back on me. We tumbled down the hatch together. I struck on
      my head, and fortunately he fell on my hips. As he was a man of at least
      two hundred pounds' weight, I would have been crushed to death if he had
      fallen directly across my body. I lay for some moments stunned by the
      blow, but soon recovered consciousness enough to rush up on deck. The
      captain, seeing me covered with blood, asked if I was wounded, to which I
      replied, 'I believe not, sir.' 'Then,' said he, 'where are the primers?'
      This first brought me completely to my senses, and I ran below again and
      carried the primers on deck. When I came up the second time, I saw the
      captain fall, and in my turn ran up and asked if he was wounded. He
      answered me almost in the same words, 'I believe not, my son; but I felt a
      blow on the top of my head.' He must have been knocked down by the windage
      of a passing shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When my services were not required for other purposes, I generally
      assisted in working a gun; would run and bring powder from the boys, and
      send them back for more, until the captain wanted me to carry a message.
      <span class="pagenum">317</span><a name="link317" id="link317"></a>"I have
      already remarked how soon I became accustomed to scenes of blood and death
      during the action; but after the battle had ceased, when, on going below,
      I saw the mangled bodies of my shipmates, dead and dying, groaning and
      expiring with the most patriotic sentiments on their lips, I became faint
      and sick. As soon as I recovered from the first shock, however, I hastened
      to assist the surgeon. Among the badly wounded was one of my best friends,
      Lieutenant J. G. Cowell. When I spoke to him he said, 'O Davy, I fear it
      is all up with me.' I found that he had lost a leg just above the knee,
      and the doctor informed me that his life might have been saved if he had
      consented to the amputation of the limb an hour before; but when it was
      proposed to drop another patient and attend to him, he replied, 'No,
      doctor, none of that; fair play is a jewel. One man's life is as dear as
      another's; I would not cheat any poor fellow out of his turn.' Thus died
      one of the best officers and bravest men among us.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was wonderful to find dying men, who had hardly ever attracted notice
      among the ship's company, uttering sentiments worthy of a Washington. You
      might have heard in all directions, 'Don't give her up, Logan!'&mdash;a
      sobriquet for Porter&mdash;'Hurrah for liberty!' and similar expressions.
      A young <span class="pagenum">318</span><a name="link318" id="link318"></a>Scotchman
      named Bissley had one leg shot off close to the groin. He used his
      handkerchief for a tourniquet, and said to his comrades, 'I left my own
      country and adopted the United States, to fight for her. I hope I have
      this day proved myself worthy of the country of my adoption. I am no
      longer of any use to you or to her, so good-by!' With these words, he
      leaned on the sill of the port and threw himself overboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lieutenant Wilmer, who had been sent forward to let go the sheet anchor,
      was knocked overboard by a shot. After the action, his little Negro boy,
      Ruff, came on deck and asked me what had become of his master, and when I
      imparted to him the sad news, he deliberately jumped into the sea and was
      drowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I went on board the <i>Phoebe</i> about 8 A.M. on the 29th, and was
      ushered into the steerage. I was so mortified at our capture that I could
      not refrain from tears. While in this uncomfortable state, I was aroused
      by hearing a young reefer call out, 'A prize! a prize! Ho, boys, a fine
      grunter, by Jove!' I saw at once that he had under his arm a pet pig
      belonging to our ship, called Murphy. I claimed the animal as my own.
      'Ah,' said he, 'but you are a prisoner, and your pig also.' 'We always
      respect private property,' I replied, and as I <span class="pagenum">319</span><a
      name="link319" id="link319"></a>had seized hold of Murphy I determined not
      to let go, unless compelled by superior force. This was fun for the
      oldsters, who immediately sung out, 'Go it, my little Yankee! If you can
      thrash Shorty, you shall have your pig!' 'Agreed!' said I. A ring was
      formed, and at it we went. I soon found that my antagonist's pugilistic
      education did not come up to mine. In fact, he was no match for me, and
      was compelled to give up the pig. So I took Master Murphy under my arm,
      feeling that I had in some degree wiped out the disgrace of our defeat."
      Porter and his surviving men were paroled, and the <i>Essex Junior</i> was
      converted into a cartel, in which they were sent home to New York. When
      she was within about thirty miles of her destination, she was overhauled
      by a British war-vessel and detained all night, which by the terms of the
      agreement with Captain Hillyar absolved them from their parole. In the
      morning Captain Porter with a few men left the ship in a small boat,
      unnoticed, and pulled for shore, landing at Babylon, Long Island, about
      sunset. He was immediately made a prisoner by the militia; but when he
      exhibited his commission, they fired a salute of twenty-one guns and
      furnished a horse and cart to carry his boat. On reaching New York, he
      received a grand ovation, and as he rode through the streets the people
      unhitched <span class="pagenum">320</span><a name="link320" id="link320"></a>his
      horses and drew the carriage themselves. Thus ended one of the most
      exciting, varied, and romantic cruises ever made by a modern sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 29th of April the American sloop-of-war <i>Peacock</i>, carrying
      eighteen guns and commanded by Captain Lewis Warrington, was cruising off
      the coast of Florida when she sighted the British brig-of-war <i>Epervier,</i>
      eighteen guns, convoying three merchantmen. The two men-of-war hauled up
      for action, and after a battle of forty-two minutes the English flag was
      struck. The <i>Epervier</i> had lost twenty-two men killed or wounded, her
      rigging was badly cut up, and there was five feet of water in the hold,
      more than forty shot having entered her hull. The <i>Peacock</i>, which
      was much heavier than her antagonist, had received very little injury, and
      but two of her crew were wounded. The prize had $118,000 in specie on
      board. Soon after this the <i>Peacock</i> cruised in the Bay of Biscay and
      along the coast of Portugal, and captured fourteen merchantmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Johnston Blakeley, in the <i>Wasp</i>, a sister ship to the <i>Peacock</i>,
      sailed from Portsmouth, N. H., for a cruise in the chops of the English
      Channel. At daylight on the 28th of June he sighted two sail on the lee
      beam and one on the weather beam. Avoiding the former, he made for the
      latter, which proved to be the British brig <i>Reindeer</i>, of eighteen
      <span class="pagenum">321</span><a name="link321" id="link321"></a>guns.
      There was considerable manoeuvring for the weather-gauge, but the
      Englishman succeeded in keeping it, and by three o'clock had come within
      sixty yards. At that short distance she had five shots at the Wasp, with a
      shifting carronade, firing round shot and grape, before the Wasp could
      bring a single gun to bear on her. But Blakeley then made a half-board,
      and by firing from aft forward finally brought every gun into use. This
      was too heavy for the <i>Reindeer</i>, and she ran into the <i>Wasp</i>
      and attempted to board, her crew being led by Captain Manners in person.
      But every attempt was repelled by the crew of the <i>Wasp</i>, and when
      Captain Blakeley ordered them in turn to board the enemy, they were on her
      deck and the British flag was hauled down in one minute. The whole action
      had lasted but half an hour. The <i>Reindeer</i> had lost twenty-five
      killed, including her captain, and forty-two wounded; the <i>Wasp</i>,
      five killed and twenty-two wounded. The upper half of the hull of the
      Reindeer was a complete wreck, and she had to be burned. A few weeks
      later, September 1st, the <i>Wasp</i>, after making three prizes,
      discovered four sail and bore up for the most weatherly of them. Between
      nine and ten o'clock at night the two ships came close together, and
      broadsides were exchanged till the enemy became silent. Blakeley hailed,
      and <span class="pagenum">322</span><a name="link322" id="link322"></a>was
      answered that she surrendered. She was the British brig <i>Avon</i>, of
      eighteen guns. But before the Americans had taken possession of her,
      another British man-of-war came up. The <i>Wasp</i> made ready to engage
      her; but before she could do so, two others appeared, and she then put up
      her helm and ran off before the wind. It was afterward learned that the <i>Avon</i>
      had sunk, and her consort with difficulty rescued the survivors of her
      crew. In the next twenty days the <i>Wasp</i> took three prizes, and then,
      continuing her cruise, was never heard from again.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the bloodiest sea-fights of this year took place in the harbor of
      Fayal, Azores. The American privateer <i>General Armstrong</i>, carrying
      fourteen guns and ninety men, commanded by Captain Samuel C. Reid, put in
      there for water on the 26th of September. A few hours later, three British
      war-vessels&mdash;the <i>Plantagenet, Carnation, and Rota</i>&mdash;entered
      the harbor. It was a neutral port, but they cared no more for its
      neutrality than Hillyar had cared for that of Valparaiso.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening, under a full moon, four armed boats were sent from these
      vessels to cut out the privateer. As they approached her, they were warned
      off several times, but paid no attention to it, and attempted to board.
      Reid then opened fire on them, and drove them off with heavy loss. For
      <span class="pagenum">323</span><a name="link323" id="link323"></a>greater
      security, the <i>Armstrong</i> was hauled up close to the fort, and
      moored. The Governor remonstrated with Captain Van Lloyd, commander of the
      English fleet; to which the captain answered that he was determined to
      destroy the privateer, and if the fort protected her he would bombard the
      town till not a house was left standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      At midnight the <i>Armstrong</i> was attacked again, this time by fourteen
      launches, each carrying about fifty men. Reid promptly opened his
      broadside on them, with terrible effect; yet two or three of them
      succeeded in reaching the vessel, and the crew then met them with cutlass
      and pistol, and scarcely a man in them was left alive. A letter written
      from Fayal at the time, by an Englishman, says the officers in charge of
      the boats cheered on their men with a shout of "No quarter!" and that "the
      Americans fought with great firmness, but more like bloodthirsty savages
      than anything else. They rushed into the boats, sword in hand, and put
      every soul to death, as far as came within their power. Several boats
      floated on shore, full of dead bodies."
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning, the <i>Carnation</i> sailed in and engaged the <i>Armstrong</i>;
      but after a short action she was badly cut up and obliged to haul off for
      repairs. Several guns on the <i>Armstrong</i> had been dismounted; and as
      Captain Reid now saw that her <span class="pagenum">324</span><a
      name="link324" id="link324"></a>ultimate destruction was certain, he cut
      away her masts, blew a hole in her bottom, and went ashore with his men.
      Two of the crew had been killed, and seven wounded. The ascertained loss
      of the British was one hundred and twenty killed and ninety wounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      After burning the abandoned wreck, Van Lloyd demanded of the Governor that
      the gallant little crew he had failed to capture should be given up to him
      as prisoners. This modest request was of course refused, and Captain Reid
      and his men then took possession of an old convent, declaring that they
      would defend themselves to the last. But they were not molested.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vessel that was despatched to England to take home the British sailors
      wounded in this action, was not permitted to carry a single letter from
      anybody. Indeed, not only this affair, says Cobbett in his "Letters," but
      the loss of the <i>Avon</i>, the battle of Plattsburg, and other actions
      not creditable to the English arms, were carefully concealed from the
      English public. At the demand of Portugal, the British Government
      apologized for the violation of neutrality; but the owners of the <i>Armstrong</i>
      never obtained any indemnity.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the last naval action before the declaration of peace; but as
      that declaration did not imme<span class="pagenum">325</span><a
      name="link325" id="link325"></a>diately reach the cruisers at sea, three
      others were fought. On the 15th of January, 1815, Commodore Decatur, in
      the <i>President</i>, had a prolonged battle with the frigate <i>Endymion</i>,
      off Long Island, and reduced her to a wreck. But two other British
      cruisers came up, and he was compelled to surrender.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had lost eighty men killed or wounded. On the 20th of February, the <i>Constitution</i>,
      Captain Charles Stewart, off the coast of Portugal, captured both the <i>Cyane</i>,
      of thirty-four guns, and the <i>Levant</i>, of twenty-one, after a battle
      of forty minutes, in which he lost fifteen men, and inflicted a loss of
      about forty. The <i>Levant</i> was subsequently recaptured by three
      English cruisers, while she was in Port Praya, another neutral harbor. On
      the 23d of March, the American brig <i>Hornet</i>, Captain James Biddle,
      and the British brig <i>Penguin</i>, Captain Dickenson, being almost
      exactly matched in men and metal, fought a battle of twenty-two minutes'
      duration, off the island of Tristan d'Acunha, at the close of which the <i>Penguin</i>,
      having lost forty-two men and been badly crippled, surrendered. Her
      commander was killed. The <i>Hornet</i> had one man killed and ten
      wounded. This was the last of what the London <i>Times</i> had fallen into
      the habit of calling "the painful events at sea."

      <i>Attitude of the Federalists, Real and Imputed&mdash;The Convention at
      Hartford&mdash;Its Popular Reputation&mdash;What General Scott did not say
      at Chippewa.</i>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hen a destructive
      war had been carried on for two years, when recruiting was slow, and the
      Government heavily in debt, and yet no way appeared but to fight it out,
      it might have been expected that harsh criticism of the policy of the
      Administration, coming from the party that had steadily opposed the war,
      would subject that party to the charge of being unpatriotic and untrue to
      the Union. It might also have been expected that an opposition which had
      become chronic could not but become in some respects unjust. So when the
      Federalists in 1814 were flooding the Legislatures of New England with
      memorials on the conduct of the war, they could hardly restrain themselves
      from overdrawing the picture of its failures, or from representing the
      condition of things before the war as rather more paradisiacal than
      anybody had suspected. And on the other hand, they were accused not only
      of <span class="pagenum">327</span><a name="link327" id="link327"></a>rejoicing
      in defeats of the national arms, but of plotting a separation of New
      England from the other States, with a view of ultimately making her again
      a part of the British Empire. That there were some Federalists who
      contemplated a dissolution of the Union as a possible remedy for certain
      difficulties, is quite probable, for such views were at that time not
      confined to either party. The contingency of disunion was frequently
      discussed by men of both parties. But that anybody seriously contemplated
      a reunion with England, there has never been any evidence worth
      considering. The story was gotten up by the Administration party, in order
      to cast odium upon the Federalists; and the occurrence most freely used to
      give color to it was the Hartford Convention, which unfortunately sat with
      closed doors, and thus was easily misrepresented as a treasonable
      gathering.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the third year of the war the hand of the enemy had fallen heavily upon
      the coast of New England, and at the same time an unpleasant feeling had
      arisen from the refusal of the United States Government to pay the militia
      that had been in service under State officers. In this crisis, the
      Legislature of Massachusetts, on the 16th of October, by a vote of 260 to
      90, passed a series of resolutions, the fifth of which authorized the
      calling of a con<span class="pagenum">328</span><a name="link328"
      id="link328"></a>vention to confer "upon the subject of their [the New
      England States] public grievances and concerns; and upon the best means of
      preserving our resources; and of defence against the enemy; and to devise
      and suggest for adoption by those respective States such measures as they
      may deem expedient; and also to take measures, if they shall think it
      proper, for procuring a convention of delegates from all the United
      States, in order to revise the Constitution thereof, and more effectually
      to secure the support and attachment of all the people, by placing all
      upon the basis of fair representation." The letter addressed to the
      governors of other States set forth the general objects of the proposed
      conference to be, "to deliberate upon the dangers to which the eastern
      section of the Union is exposed by the course of the war, and to devise,
      if practicable, means of security and defence which may be consistent with
      the preservation of their resources from total ruin, and adapted to their
      local situation, mutual relations, and habits, and not repugnant to their
      obligations as members of the Union."
    </p>
    <p>
      In response to this call, a convention of twenty-six delegates met at
      Hartford, Conn., December 15th, and sat for three weeks. All sorts of
      absurd rumors as to the purpose of the Convention were set <span
      class="pagenum">329</span><a name="link329" id="link329"></a>afloat, and
      the President so far participated in the vague fears thus excited, or
      pretended to, as to station a regiment of troops in Hartford.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 5th of January, 1815, the Convention adjourned, and published a
      long report, wherein were set forth the difficulties that the country
      labored under, and methods proposed by the Convention for adjusting them.
      These were first discussed at length, and then summarized in a series of
      resolutions: That unconstitutional drafts of militia should be prevented;
      that the New England States should be empowered to defend their own
      territory against the enemy; that representatives and direct taxes should
      be apportioned among the States according to the number of their free
      inhabitants; that a two-third vote of Congress should be required to admit
      a new State; that embargoes for more than sixty days should be forbidden;
      that a two-third Congressional vote should be required for the
      interdiction of commercial intercourse, or for the declaration of
      offensive war; that naturalized citizens should not be eligible to Federal
      offices; that the President should be ineligible for a second term, and
      should not be chosen from the same State twice in succession; and,
      finally, that if these ends were not attained, and peace not concluded,
      another convention should be held in Boston in the following June. <span
      class="pagenum">330</span><a name="link330" id="link330"></a>This ought to
      have been plain enough for anybody to understand; and yet allusions to
      "the old blue-lights of the Hartford Convention," as a synonym for
      treason, have come down to our own day. Its popularity as a bugbear has
      never been exceeded. So great was its influence in this regard, that it
      caused General Scott to remember something which had never taken place. In
      his account of the battle of Chippewa he says: "And now the New England
      States were preparing to hold a convention&mdash;it met at Hartford&mdash;perhaps
      to secede from the Union &mdash;possibly to take up arms against it.
      Scott's brigade, nearly all New England men, were most indignant, and this
      was the subject of the second of the three pithy remarks made to them by
      Scott just before the final conflict of Chippewa. Calling aloud to the
      gallant Major Hindman, he said, 'Let us put down the Federal Convention by
      beating the enemy in front. There's nothing in the Constitution against
      that.'" * There can be no question as to the intrinsic pithiness of this
      remark; but if Scott made it, he must have been somewhat of a prophet, for
      the battle of Chippewa was fought on the 5th of July, and the call for the
      Convention was not issued till October. This shows the danger of writing

    <p>
      The great news from the South, and the tidings of peace, followed so
      quickly upon the adjournment of the Convention that its labors went for
      nought, its members were subjected to merciless ridicule, and the new
      convention proposed for June was never held.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>hough Pensacola
      was a Spanish town, in Spanish territory, the British forces used it as a
      station for fitting out expeditions against Mobile and New Orleans. Here
      they gathered arms and munitions of war; here their vessels found safe
      anchorage in a spacious harbor, where they were afforded every facility
      for refitting; and here the savage allies were equipped for war and
      murder. The British commander sent an embassy to Jean Lafitte, at
      Barataria Bay, offering him a captain's commission, together with a free
      pardon for all his gang, and grants of land to be carved out of such
      territory as might be conquered from the United States, on condition that
      he and his men would assist with their fleet the expeditions then fitting
      out. The English commander also hinted darkly at something which he called
      "the blessings of the British constitution"&mdash;probably meaning the
      abundant bone and muscle of a beef-eater&mdash;as an additional inducement
      <span class="pagenum">333</span><a name="link333" id="link333"></a>to the
      famous little Frenchman. Lafitte was commonly called a pirate, but that
      was not precisely his character. He was a receiver of stolen goods
      captured by half-piratical privateers, which he smuggled into New Orleans.
      But, pirate or no pirate, he seems to have been too shrewd for the
      Englishman. He appeared to acquiesce till he obtained the terms in black
      and white, and then despatched the letters to Governor Claiborne of
      Louisiana, together with one in which he offered his services in defending
      the coast against the British, on condition that the proscription of
      himself and his adherents be terminated by an act of oblivion. The
      Governor laid the letters before a council of military and naval officers,
      who decided that they were forgeries and Lafitte a scoundrel. Consequently
      an expedition under Commodore Patterson was sent against him, by which his
      establishment was broken up, nine of his vessels were seized, and many of
      his men made prisoners.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning in July, General Jackson was presented with a new English
      musket, brought to his headquarters by a friendly Indian who had received
      it from the Creeks at Appalachicola. This told an alarming story, which
      the General at once communicated to Governor Claiborne and the Secretary
      of War. Of the latter he asked permission to make a <span class="pagenum">334</span><a
      name="link334" id="link334"></a>descent upon Pensacola. Before an answer
      was received, Jackson was joined by new levies of troops from Tennessee,
      which he hurried to Mobile.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Mobile Point, commanding the entrance to the bay, stood a ruinous
      earthwork known as Fort Bowyer. Major William Lawrence, with a garrison of
      one hundred and sixty men, took possession of this, and proceeded to put
      it in shape for defence. On the 12th of September, the British landed a
      detachment of marines and six hundred Indians on the peninsula of which
      Mobile Point is the extremity, and a few hours later four war-vessels,
      under Captain Percy, appeared at the entrance of the bay. Two or three
      days were passed in feeble demonstrations on the land side, and attempts
      to sound the channel; but on the afternoon of the 15th the fleet sailed up
      in line, dropped anchor in the channel, and opened the battle. For an hour
      the firing was incessant; it ceased for a moment when the colors of the
      flag-ship <i>Hermes</i> were shot away; but was soon renewed, when a
      chance shot cut the cable of the <i>Hermes</i>, the current swung her
      bow-on to the fort, and for twenty minutes she was raked mercilessly. She
      drifted down the channel and ran aground, when Captain Percy abandoned her
      and set her on fire. Another vessel was crippled and driven off, and the
      other two then withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">335</span><a name="link335" id="link335"></a>The
      simultaneous assaults of the marines and Indians had been met and repelled
      with a few discharges of grape. In this action the garrison lost four men
      killed and four wounded; the British official report acknowledged a loss
      of thirty-two killed and forty wounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in November, Jackson, with three thousand men, marched on Pensacola,
      where he proposed to garrison the forts till the Spanish authorities were
      able to maintain for themselves the neutrality of the port. This
      proposition being rejected by the Spanish Governor, Jackson's men charged
      into the town and captured a battery, and took possession. That night Fort
      Barrancas, commanding the entrance to the harbor, was blown up, and the
      British vessels sailed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hurrying back to Mobile, where he feared a second attack, Jackson learned
      of the revelations of Lafitte and was urged to go to the defence of New
      Orleans. He arrived in that city on the 2d of December, was
      enthusiastically welcomed, and at once set to work to prepare it for
      defence. He called out the Louisiana militia, appealed to the free
      negroes, released and enrolled convicts whose terms were within two months
      of expiration, accepted the services of Lafitte and his men, assigning
      them to duty as artillerists, and ordered Coffee with his two <span
      class="pagenum">336</span><a name="link336" id="link336"></a>thousand men
      to join him from Mobile. While looking anxiously for new levies from
      Kentucky and Tennessee, who were to come by way of the river, he fortified
      the city, and proclaimed martial law.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 10th of December the British fleet entered Lake Borgne, where on
      the 14th it defeated and captured the American gunboats. On the 23d a body
      of two thousand four hundred British troops reached the bank of the
      Mississippi nine miles below New Orleans, and with two thousand one
      hundred Jackson went down to meet them.
    </p>
    <p>
      New Orleans was the largest prize which had been contended for in this
      war. It was a city of twenty thousand inhabitants; and a hundred and fifty
      thousand bales of cotton, worth two shillings a pound, were stored there.
      But it was not so much its immediate pecuniary value that tempted the
      enemy, as the commercial and strategical importance of its position, for
      they expected not only to capture but to hold it permanently. Lieutenant
      Gleig, author of "The Subaltern," who was connected with the expedition,
      after describing the Mississippi and its tributaries, wrote: "Whatever
      nation, therefore, chances to possess this place, possesses in reality the
      command of a greater extent of country than is included within the
      boundary line of the whole United States," and the London <i>Times</i>, an<span
      class="pagenum">337</span><a name="link337" id="link337"></a>nouncing that
      all the disposable shipping had been sent from Bermuda, to the
      Mississippi, added that, "most active measures are pursuing for detaching
      from the dominion of the enemy an important part of his territory."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wellington's veterans, fresh from their victories in the Spanish
      peninsula, were now before the city, and the inhabitants, knowing how
      hasty had been the preparations for defence, trembled for its safety. The
      expectation was, that, if captured, it would at once be sacked.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late in the day when Jackson moved to the attack. He sent Coffee
      and his Tennesseeans to gain the right flank and rear of the enemy, while
      the rest of his forces were to deploy across the narrow strip of land
      between the river and a morass, and attack in front. The schooner <i>Carolina</i>
      was ordered to move down to a point opposite the British left, and
      enfilade the position; her first discharge to be the signal for the land
      attack. It was half-past seven o'clock when she opened the battle with a
      broadside that tore through the British camp and swept down a large number
      of men. The moon was young and obscured by clouds, so that there was
      almost absolute darkness, except when the flashes of the guns momentarily
      lighted up one or another part of the field. <span class="pagenum">338</span><a
      name="link338" id="link338"></a>The two armies soon became intermingled,
      and, as one of the participants wrote, "no man could tell what was going
      forward in any quarter, except where he himself chanced immediately to
      stand; no one part of the line could bring assistance to another, because
      in truth no line existed." The fighting was mostly hand-to-hand; few of
      the Americans had bayonets, but many carried long knives, and the most
      ghastly wounds were given and received. Officers on either side would
      gather little companies of men and go out into the darkness to find the
      enemy; but when they had come in contact with an armed party like
      themselves, it was often impossible to say whether they were friends or
      foes.
    </p>
    <p>
      After three hours of this bloody work, the Americans withdrew to works
      four miles from the city. They had lost twenty-four killed, one hundred
      and fifteen wounded, and seventy-four missing. General Keane's official
      report made the British loss forty-six killed, one hundred and sixty-seven
      wounded, and sixty-four missing. Lieutenant Gleig, in his "Narrative,"
      says, "Not less than five hundred men had fallen, many of whom were our
      finest soldiers and best officers; and yet we could not but consider
      ourselves fortunate in escaping from the toils, even at the expense of so
      great a sacrifice." A journal found upon a British officer <span
      class="pagenum">339</span><a name="link339" id="link339"></a>who was
      killed in the battle of January 8th, puts the loss in this action at "two
      hundred and twenty-four killed, and an immense number wounded."
    </p>
    <p>
      Heavy reënforcements of British troops soon arrived, and with them
      Generals Sir Edward Pakenham and Samuel Gibbs. Pakenham, a brother-in-law
      of the Duke of Wellington, had won considerable distinction in the
      Peninsular War. He found the army before New Orleans in a pitiful plight.
      It was encamped on a strip of low and level land, on one side a broad
      river where it had no vessels, and on the other an almost impassable
      morass. In front were fortifications that were continually being
      strengthened, and of the enemy behind them almost nothing was known; while
      two armed vessels kept up day and night an enfilading fire. With all this,
      alternate rain and frost left them scarcely a comfortable hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pakenham's first movement was to bring heavy guns and a furnace across the
      peninsula by night, and plant them on the levee; from which on the morning
      of the 27th he opened a fire with hot shot, and in half an hour had driven
      the <i>Louisiana</i> up stream and set the <i>Carolina</i> on fire, so
      that she was abandoned and blew up.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 28th he made a reconnoissance in force. As the left wing approached
      the American lines, a <span class="pagenum">340</span><a name="link340"
      id="link340"></a>group of buildings which Jackson's men had filled with
      combustibles was fired by a hot shot from one of his guns, and amid the
      heat and smoke the British saw before them an impassable ditch, from
      behind which a few pieces of artillery, handled with the utmost skill,
      poured destruction through their ranks. The right wing found the left of
      Jackson's position weak, effected a lodgment within the lines, and might
      perhaps have changed the fortunes of the campaign, had not its leader been
      instructed that this was to be a reconnoissance, not a battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pakenham now resolved upon regular siege operations, and brought thirty
      guns from the fleet, which in the night of the 31st he mounted within
      three hundred yards of the American lines. His troops were encamped in the
      midst of sugar plantations, and a considerable portion of his new ramparts
      was formed of hogsheads of sugar, set on end.
    </p>
    <p>
      When day dawned, and the Americans saw thirty guns frowning down upon them
      from high bastions that had risen as if by magic in the darkness, the
      sight was rather appalling; but as soon as fire was opened upon these
      apparently formidable works, it was seen that the balls passed right
      through the hogsheads of sugar, and the whole fabric began to crumble
      away. There was also a vulnerable element in Jackson's works; for he had
      used cotton <span class="pagenum">341</span><a name="link341" id="link341"></a>bales
      as his enemy used sugar, and though the cotton resisted the passage of a
      ball, it was easily set on fire, and the bales knocked out of position.
    </p>
    <p>
      Commodore Patterson had erected a battery on the opposite bank of the
      Mississippi, to rake the ground held by the British, who at the same time
      had erected one on the levee to oppose it. For an hour these guns were all
      blazing at once; and when the firing ceased and the smoke rolled away, it
      was found that the British works had been completely ruined, and seventy
      of their men killed or wounded; the American works were not seriously
      damaged, but they had lost thirty-four men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jackson made haste to throw away his cotton bales, supply their place with
      earth, and construct a second line of works a mile and a half in the rear,
      and for a week nervously awaited the next move of the enemy. In that week
      he was joined by nearly three thousand Kentucky and Louisiana militia; but
      as they were in rags and had scarcely a firelock among them, they could
      hardly be considered a reënforcement. The British were reenforced by two
      regiments under General John Lambert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pakenham's final plan was to send a heavy force across the river to
      capture Patterson's batteries and turn them upon Jackson's lines, and at
      the same time push forward the remainder of his force to as<span
      class="pagenum">342</span><a name="link342" id="link342"></a>sault those
      lines in front, the advance guard to fill the ditch with fascines and
      plant scaling-ladders against the ramparts. Preparatory to this, it was
      necessary to dig a canal across the isthmus, to drag boats through from
      Lake Borgne to the Mississippi, and this occupied his troops nearly six
      days.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Saturday, January 7th, Jackson stood upon the tallest building within
      his lines, and through a large spy-glass which a planter had mounted for
      him, saw the red-coats making fascines by binding up sheaves of
      sugar-cane, and constructing ladders. At the same time, Pakenham was
      surveying the American works from the top of a pine-tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      The British general intended to make an attack on both sides of the river
      simultaneously, before daylight on the 8th. But there was great difficulty
      in navigating the canal, the sides of which had caved in; only enough
      boats were brought through to carry over five hundred troops, instead of
      fourteen hundred, and these were delayed several hours. A detachment under
      Colonel Thornton embarked in them, but were swept down by the current and
      reached the western shore far below the intended landing-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the sun had risen, the fog was rolling away, Pakenham was
      impatient, and before Thornton could get near his enemy he saw the signal
      <span class="pagenum">343</span><a name="link343" id="link343"></a>rocket
      which announced the attack. The Americans understood the signal quite as
      well as he did, and were ready to meet the shock. One thirty-two pounder
      was loaded to the muzzle with musket-balls. A deserter had told the
      British commander that the weak spot in Jackson's line was the extreme
      left; true enough when he said it, but now that spot was strengthened by
      two thousand Tennessee and Kentucky riflemen. The heaviest attack was
      accordingly made at this point, a column of three thousand men, under
      General Gibbs, moving against it. They were to be preceded by an Irish
      regiment bearing the fascines and ladders. At the same time, a column of
      one thousand moved along the river road, under the cross-fire from
      Patterson's battery, to attack Jackson's right. These were to be preceded
      by a West India black regiment with the necessary fascines and ladders.
      Midway between stood nearly a thousand Highlanders, under General Keane,
      ready to support either column, as circumstances might require. The
      British had also a battery of six eighteen-pounders; and, drawn up behind
      all, a considerable reserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      The battle was what Bunker Hill would have been if the Americans had had
      stronger works and plenty of ammunition. The beautiful British columns
      moved forward only to be mowed down. When <span class="pagenum">344</span><a
      name="link344" id="link344"></a>the thirty-two pounder discharged its
      musket-balls, the head of one column melted away before it, two hundred
      men being disabled. Both the Irish and the Negro regiment failed in their
      duty, so that when the main columns arrived at the ditch they had no means
      of crossing, and the terrible blunder had to be remedied under a
      continuous and withering fire. The ranks were badly broken. Pakenham,
      trying to re-form them, was killed, falling into the arms of Captain
      McDougall, the same officer who had caught General Ross when he fell at
      North Point. General Gibbs was wounded mortally; General Keane seriously.
      Colonel Dale fell at the head of the Highland regiment, which was almost
      entirely destroyed. It went into the fight with over nine hundred men, and
      came out with one hundred and forty. A major and a lieutenant, with twenty
      men, crossed the ditch before the American left, and the two officers
      mounted the breastwork. The major was instantly riddled with bullets; the
      lieutenant demanded the swords of two officers who confronted him, and was
      told to look behind him. He turned, and saw, as he expressed it, that the
      men he supposed to be following "had vanished as if the earth had opened
      and swallowed them up."
    </p>
    <p>
      On the American right, the British carried a small outwork; but the guns
      of the main line were turned <span class="pagenum">345</span><a
      name="link345" id="link345"></a>upon it and cleared it. Of this column,
      only three men&mdash;a colonel, a major, and a captain&mdash;reached the
      breastwork, and as they mounted they were all shot and tumbled into the
      ditch together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The action lasted but twenty-five minutes. Seven hundred of the British
      were killed, fourteen hundred wounded, and five hundred prisoners. The
      Americans lost four killed and thirteen wounded; in the entire campaign,
      three hundred and thirty-three.
    </p>
    <p>
      The force under Thornton, on the western bank of the river, carried the
      American works, where but brief resistance was made, and were pursuing the
      retreating militia, when news of the disaster on the other bank was
      brought to Thornton, together with an order to return. He had lost a
      hundred men, killed or wounded, and inflicted a loss of but six.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 9th was spent, under an armistice, in burying the dead and caring for
      the wounded. General Lambert then determined to withdraw to the shipping
      and abandon the enterprise, but was ten days about it, during which time
      his troops were annoyed by incessant cannonading by day and "hunting
      parties" by night. The British fleet had entered the Mississippi at its
      mouth, and from the 10th to the 17th bombarded Fort St. Philip,
      seventy-five miles below New Orleans, but effected nothing, and on the
      18th withdrew.

      <i>The Treaty of Ghent&mdash;Treatment of Prisoners&mdash;Losses and Gains
      by the War&mdash;Conclusion.</i>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>ad there been an
      Atlantic cable, or even a transatlantic steamer, with land telegraphs, in
      those days, the slaughter before New Orleans might have been prevented;
      for a treaty of peace had been signed at Ghent on the 24th of December,
      1814. It made the usual stipulations for the exchange of prisoners and the
      return of property, guaranteed peace to the Indians, and provided for a
      settlement by commissioners of questions as to boundary and the islands in
      Passamaquoddy Bay,&mdash;and it provided for little else. The negotiations
      had been going on for five months, and more than once were in danger of
      being broken off on account of the insolent and supercilious bearing of
      the English Commissioners. So says Adams in his diary.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the outset, the British Commissioners had insisted that the Indians
      should have a territory set off to them, as neutral ground between the
      British and the American possessions, and that the United States should
      have no armament on the great lakes <span class="pagenum">347</span><a
      name="link347" id="link347"></a>and no fortifications on their shores,
      while Canada was not to be restricted. On the other hand, the American
      Commissioners had insisted on formal abrogation of the right of search and
      impressment. But all these points were ultimately given up. As early as
      June the American Commissioners had been instructed by the President that
      they might omit any stipulation on the subject of impressment, if it was
      found indispensably necessary to do so in order to terminate the war; and
      acting under this instruction they yielded to the argument that, as Europe
      was now at peace, there was no longer any occasion for exercising the
      right, and therefore no practical necessity for mentioning it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The treaty was severely criticised and mercilessly ridiculed as a
      meaningless document. It might have been answered that the Federalists at
      least had no right to complain, since they had clamored only for peace,
      and the treaty brought peace. Better than this, it might have been
      answered that when a point has been practically settled by war, it is of
      little consequence whether it is conceded on paper; since every nation is
      likely to heed a lesson taught by force of arms, and equally likely, when
      interest dictates, to abrogate a treaty; and, whatever might be said of
      the campaigns on land, it could not be denied that American mariners had
      abundantly vin<span class="pagenum">348</span><a name="link348"
      id="link348"></a>dicated their right to an unmolested navigation of the
      high seas&mdash;a right which British cruisers have never since interfered
      with.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been no exchange of prisoners during the war, though many had
      been paroled, and there were bitter complaints of the treatment received
      by Americans in British prisons. This was especially true of those
      confined at Dartmoor, the most unhealthful spot in the dreary highlands of
      Devonshire. These men were not only not released, but were not even
      informed that peace had been concluded, till three months after the treaty
      was signed. There seemed to be a special spite against them because they
      were mostly American sailors, who had audaciously and successfully
      disputed England's sovereignty of the seas.
    </p>

      If it be a matter of pride, as an English poetess appears to think, for a
      nation to strew its dead over the face of the globe, * then Great Britain
      certainly won fresh laurels in this war; for her soldiers who fell in it
      found graves six thousand miles apart: in the depths of Lake Erie, about
      the great falls of Niagara, and along the Thames and St. Lawrence; in the
      Atlantic, both near the American coast and almost within sight of their
      own shores; in Long Island Sound,

      <span class="pagenum">349</span><a name="link349" id="link349"></a>in the
      Chesapeake, and beyond the western edge of civilization; before the
      defences of Baltimore and New Orleans, and in the waters of the South
      Pacific. And her expeditions had been especially fatal to their
      commanders: Gen. Brock had fallen at Queenstown, Gen. Tecumseh at the
      Thames, Ross and Sir Peter Parker before Baltimore, Pakenham and Gibbs at
      New Orleans, with many of lower rank but hardly less responsibility; while
      seven commanders of her men-of-war&mdash;Lambert, Downie, Dickenson,
      Manners, Peake, Barrette, and Blythe&mdash;had all died on their bloody
      decks. But by her sacrifice of life and property she had gained absolutely
      nothing. She had not acquired an inch of territory, or established any
      principle of international law, or purchased for herself any new
      privilege, or secured any old one. The war had cost the United States a
      hundred million dollars in money, and thirty thousand lives; and a large
      portion of both the money and the lives had been squandered, when with
      ordinary skill and care they might have been saved. But she had something
      to show for it. If she had not fully relieved her from tier of the
      atrocities of the Indians, she had at least cut off their supplies from
      British sources, and possessed herself of all the western posts; she had
      put an end to the systematic violation of her rights on <span
      class="pagenum">350</span><a name="link350" id="link350"></a>the ocean,
      and in so doing had demonstrated the superiority of American seamanship;
      she had completely established her national independence.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is to be hoped that no American youth who reads this little history
      will cherish any feeling of resentment or hatred toward the people whose
      fathers were so grievously unjust to ours. The day for that&mdash;if ever
      there was a day for it&mdash;has gone completely by. England has evidently
      passed the zenith of her power and glory; America is still rising toward
      hers, and how great she shall ultimately become, will be measured mainly
      by the breadth and generosity of the American mind. In the past sixty
      years we have lived down the most celebrated sneer in history. Five years
      after this war, the Rev. Sydney Smith wrote in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>:
      "In the four quarters of the globe, who reads an American book? or goes to
      an American play? or looks at an American picture or statue? What does the
      world yet owe to American physicians or surgeons? What new substances have
      their chemists discovered, or what old ones have they analyzed? What new
      constellations have been discovered by the telescopes of Americans? What
      have they done in mathematics? Who drinks out of American glasses, or eats
      from American plates, or wears American coats or gowns, or sleeps in <span
      class="pagenum">351</span><a name="link351" id="link351"></a>American
      blankets? Finally, under which of the old tyrannical governments of Europe
      is every sixth man a slave, whom his fellow citizens may buy and sell and
      torture?" If Mr. Smith were now living, he might be answered&mdash;if it
      were worth while to answer him at all&mdash;that the most widely
      circulated of all novels was written by an American woman; that the poet
      most read in England was an American; that our two standard dictionaries
      of the English language are both American; that several American magazines
      count their subscribers in Great Britain by tens of thousands; that the
      world owes its use of anaesthetics to an American physician; that American
      sculptors, painters, and actors hold their own with those of other
      nations; that America has the largest telescopes, and the most successful
      astronomers; that American reapers cut the world's harvests, and American
      sewing machines make its garments; that the telegraph and the telephone
      are American inventions; that the first steamboat was built in America,
      and it was an American steamship that first crossed the Atlantic, while
      our country contains more miles of railway than all Europe; that those who
      eat from American plates, eat the largest and best dinners in the world;
      and as for American glasses, altogether too many people drink out of them.
      Unless we mercifully left his final <span class="pagenum">352</span><a
      name="link352" id="link352"></a>question unanswered, we should be obliged
      to say, that the United States had gotten rid of slavery, while to-day
      five million British subjects, all within two days' journey of the throne,
      tell us they find themselves virtually slaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet with all our material and intellectual progress, we have hardly a
      right to be proud. For we have enjoyed peculiar advantages. The <i>Mayflower</i>
      did not land her pilgrims on a narrow island, but on the edge of a great
      continent. Of that continent we have the most productive zone, stretching
      from ocean to ocean, and a thousand miles in breadth; while within that
      zone our Government has given us, for the support of educational
      institutions, as much land as the entire area of Great Britain and
      Ireland. At the same time, we have not been loaded down with a standing
      army, an established church, a vast landed aristocracy, and all the
      rubbish of royalty. In America labor receives its highest wages, and
      pauperism finds its least excuse. It will be no special credit to us if we
      become in the next half century the most powerful and prosperous and
      generous of nations; but it will be a great shame to us if we do not.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we read the history of our country's early struggles, it may help us to
      avoid any unworthy feeling of resentment if we bear in mind the fact <span
      class="pagenum">353</span><a name="link353" id="link353"></a>that there is
      a wide and peculiar discrepancy of character between the English people
      and the English Government. That people perhaps at present the most
      enlightened on earth, are justly noted for their innate love of fair play;
      for their continual struggles toward liberty, and their development of the
      great principles of jurisprudence; but that Government, in its dealings
      with other powers, has been for centuries arbitrary, selfish, barbarous,
      and inconsistent to the last degree. Priding itself upon legitimacy, it
      has befriended a bloody usurpation in France, because it hated the
      alternative of French republicanism. It has opened the ports of China with
      its cannon, for the purpose of selling there a narcotic drug of which it
      holds the monopoly. It boasted its abolition of the slave trade; yet when
      our country was at war over the slavery question, its sympathies were all
      with the slaveholders. Seventy years ago, as we have seen, its cruisers
      cared nothing for the neutrality of any harbor in which a hostile ship of
      fewer guns was riding at anchor; but twenty years ago it could not offer
      its neutral hospitalities too lavishly to privateers that had not a port
      of their own to hail from or sail to, and were burning all their prizes at
      sea without adjudication. It witnessed the dismemberment of Denmark with
      scarcely a protest, but has <span class="pagenum">354</span><a
      name="link354" id="link354"></a>sacrificed thousands of English lives to
      maintain the Turk in Europe. It has stood for years at the head of a great
      conspiracy to keep Russia shut up in the centre of a continent long after
      her industrial growth and commercial importance have entitled her to a
      broad and unobstructed outlet to the highway of nations. It has eaten
      India into famine, and is now laying its kleptic fingers on the great
      island of Borneo, and apparently making ready to consume the continent of
      Africa.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must blush for these things while we execrate them; for we ourselves
      are Englishmen. That famous little island, with its green lanes and waving
      woodlands, its busy towns and historical hamlets, was the home of our
      ancestors, and must ever have for us the highest romantic interest of any
      spot on earth; and we cannot too warmly sympathize with those who are
      still bearing burdens of feudal days, when the bravery of feudal
      leadership has long since passed away. Let us never forget how near of kin
      we are to the English people; but God forbid that we should inherit the
      vices of the English Government, or copy its crimes!
    </p>
    <p>
      If the story of a war like that we have been reading of teaches anything,
      it teaches the broad wisdom of dealing justly, and the ultimate folly of
      all chicanery, violence, and wrong.
